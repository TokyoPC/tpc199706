<P>As I sit listening to Bob Seeger (&quot;He saw that face and he lost 
all control.&quot;...nice line...), it strikes me that this has been a 
month of escalations and beginnings for me, in about equal numbers.  
It's hard to construct a well-integrated column from that sort of 
material, so this month I'll describe some of the sea shells and 
driftwood, and leave the view of the beach for another time.  
Early in the month the floppy drive in The Beast started 
misbehaving.  Since 
I've installed <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Win95</A> 
in such a way that 
using Windows 3.11 requires booting from a floppy disk, I'm happy 
that floppies can still be read as before, but for some reason 
writing to them is no longer possible.  They're all seen as 
write-protected, regardless.  I haven't had the time to take a 
screwdriver to The Beast and see what can be done, but I have a 
feeling there's a new floppy drive in my future.</P> 

<P>There's a new hard drive to go with it.  After shifting everything 
I could spare from my 540MB IDE C: drive to an MO cartridge, I had 
about 30MB free space left on it.  On the 1GB SCSI D: drive 
(the one I thought I'd never fill), I had 3MB free.  Since I believe 
the latter drive's demise is imminent, I've acquired a new 
<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</A> 2.1GB SCSI drive.

did me a very great favor 
indeed by buying it for me, along with a couple of power 
splitters, since I've run out of power cables in The Beast, 
too.  I expect to install the new drive tomorrow...ah...make that 
today — it's going to be dawn soon — after finishing up this issue 
of the AJ, and I'll probably end up replacing the floppy 
drive while I'm at it.  In fact, it looks as if I'll have to: the 
BIOS upgrade I downloaded from 
<A HREF="http://www.gw2k.com/">Gateway 2000</A> appears to require 
installation from a floppy disk, and I'll have to write it to 
once from my hard drive.</P> 

<P>While I've got the case open, I guess I'll remove the 
<A HREF="http://www.hp.com/">Colorado</A> 250MB tape drive.  I replaced it 
a while back with a <A HREF="http://www.conner.com/">Conner</A> Travan 400MB one 
(800MB compressed) which is working beautifully, 
but I left the Colorado in its bay, disconnected.  I'll put 
the new HDD in its place and either sell the Colorado drive or 
see if it can find a new home in Beauty, the 486DX4-100 at the 
other end of the computer table.</P> 

<P>Win95 and the World Wide Web are largely responsible for 
the rapid filling up of the gig disk.  I have to keep Win 3.11 
in order to use the CD-ROM changer I need for quick access to MS 
Publisher, HiJaak, et al., and while Win95 recognizes the 
jukebox, it won't run with the driver provided by ICM, the 
changer's manufacturer.  A fax asking about a driver for 
Win95 got an answer telling me that their driver wouldn't 
work with Win95, and yoroshiku...I knew that.  Since I 
want to have a 16-bit version of 
<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape</A> for 
3.11 and a 32-bit one for Win95, I've got both taking 
up space, and since I've been experimenting with making a 
home page, I have a flock of graphics files as well as two 
shareware 
editors, <A HREF="http://www.nesbitt.com/webedit.html">WebEdit</A> (really 
easy to use) and 
<A HREF="http://www.sq.com/">HoTMetaL</A> (not so intuitive, IMO).</P>   

<P>I found that the Web page editing features in 
Netscape Navigator Gold, although not so easy 
for designing, are great for post-editing.  I was having 
problems getting some of the graphics on my page to appear 
properly, and running them through Gold's editor fixed all 
but one of my problems automatically.  It's easy to toggle 
between edit and browse mode, so you can see just how it'll look, 
at least when viewed with Netscape.</P> 

<P>The final problem I was having with the page was that I 
couldn't get the background to load properly.  It looked 
OK when browsed offline, but when I browsed from the Web, 
the background just didn't want to appear.  Although my 
original intention was to try to produce a home page 
without &quot;stealing&quot; someone else's or using a template 
(I'm trying to teach myself HTML by OJT, as it were) I 
found that I'd either have to buy a book or ask for help.  
Excellent advice from 
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Tittsler.Jim">Jim Tittsler</A>
 was, as always, quick 
in coming, and Pete Perkins at my ISP, Janis II, was extremely 
helpful, as usual. Janis II's page is well worth visiting:</P>

<P>It's still under construction (thanks,
<A HREF="http://www.factcomm.co.jp/fact/staff/darren/ehome.html">Darren</A>,
for that tip in your
<A HREF="http:../9603/homepage.html">article</A>!),
but if you'd like to see
what I've done so far, point your browser to:</P>

<P>I'm planning to add a couple of pages with links to book 
authors' pages and game-related pages; and to improve the layout 
as I learn more about how to deal with the various tags for graphics 
insertion, text handling, and the like.  I recently ordered 
HiJaak Pro's Win95 version to aid in 
this...another reason for getting the new drive installed.</P> 

<P>Next issue, I hope to be able to write about how at least some of 
these escalations and beginnings came out.  Stay tuned.</P>
