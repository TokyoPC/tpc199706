<P>Our next Executive Meeting will be April 25, Thursday, at the 
<A HREF="http://www.iac.co.jp/~mikecarr/tbc1.html">Tokyo British Club</A>, 
7 PM
(<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/bcmap.gif">see the map</A>).
Sigi should have a report with options for
buying some kind of projection device for meetings. This 
could be an overhead projector with an LCD screen or an LCD 
projector. We plan to spend up to 500,000 yen but of course need to 
keep expenses to a minimum. If anybody knows of a place to rent 
these things, or borrow them for a trade in consulting or help 
with computers, we'd sure like to know.</P> 
 
<P>News on expansion.

 and I are 
exploring options for connecting the TPC to the Internet, and 
will make a report with suggestions at the next Exec meeting (see above).</P> 
 
<P>Right now, Stuart, Jim and I (myself being the least technically 
literate) are trying to decide what we need, what we want, and if 
we can afford it. We are looking at a number of options (Jim, 
Stuart, correct me if I get any of this wrong.)</P> 
 
<P>We now have a local BBS that dials up to an internet e-mail 
provider in California
(<A HREF="http://www.holonet.net/">Holonet</A>)
each night. This makes e-mail
slow in coming and slow to return. Our connection has been down 
at times in the recent past, making reliability another concern. 
We don't have to charge for this minimal service because it doesn't 
cost so much (except for the nightly international calls, which 
run about &#165;3,000 a month).</P> 
 
<P>We'd like to at least get an internet provider here in Tokyo 
to telnet to Holonet so that we don't have to pay those 
international phone charges.</P> 

<P>We could also get what is called a <I>virtual address</I> which 
means that we can get e-mail there, maybe set up a web page, and 
even have files there available for download (FTP), and also 
get some newsgroups (conference areas) that would be accessible 
to those out on the internet. These would all be piped in to our 
computer here locally, even though the virtual server might be 
in Timbuktu. US providers do it the cheapest, but if they are 
far off the backbone the access time increases. There is also a 
difficulty with getting a domain name like TokyoPC.org in another 
country (even though Robert Irizarry has already done this for 
us at Holonet for e-mail, discussion groups are a different matter).</P> 
 
<P>Then there is Web access, which looks pretty expensive. We could 
get a leased line here in Tokyo, but that would mean we'd have to 
get members that used it to pay extra, and we'd have to become 
mini-internet providers ourselves, a big hassle.</P> 
 
<P>We could try to get a group discount rate (none yet so far in our 
explorations) at a local provider, and ask people to log on there, 
and eliminate our computer and BBS.</P> 
 
<P>These are all ideas, and we are only considering options at the 
moment, and as in a brainstorming session, we should even consider 
ridiculous options, as they may lead to something viable.</P> 
 
<H3>Your input would be appreciated.</H3>
 
<P>Thanks.</P>
