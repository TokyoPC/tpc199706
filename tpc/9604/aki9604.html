<P>Hi guys, here is a brief report from the TPC's recent Akihabara 
field trip.  This was a very special day with circumstances that 
nobody had experienced who has joined me before.... It was raining!</P> 
 
<P>And that's the reason why only four guys showed up.  They were 
our honorable treasurer, Anthony Whitman, Akihabara Groupie 

<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Nortey.Joseph">Joseph Nortey</A>
 from Ghana, Gabriel from Argentina, and a guy from the 
States whose name has slipped my mind.  Let's call him Joe to 
avoid a floating ghost during the rest of the story, OK?</P> 
 
<P>At exactly 11:00 am we were set to leave the station, but I 
granted latecomers another generous 30 second grace period.  Nobody 
arrived (Jose Caldeira, our man from Rio, 
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Boyle.Todd">Todd Boyle</A>
, and some 
others had announced their participation, but must have fallen 
victim to the rain or their badly tuned wrist watches)... 
so we marched away.</P> 
 
<P>First stop was the Laox Duty Free shop 30 meters from the station 
since one of the guys was talking about buying some presents with 
Japanese motifs.  At floor level you can find everything which you 
have ever seen and which you haven't.  Tea and sake cups with sumo 
images, chopsticks with geisha pictures, ashtrays and coasters with 
Japanese wood block prints, etc.  They also have at least 20 
different T-shirts with Japanese images on them.  From there we went 
straight to Step (PC Outlet) beyond Manseibashi Bridge.</P> 
 
<P>There was nothing particularly exciting about except the 
<A HREF="http://www.hp.com/">HP LaserJet</A> 5L which Gabriel wanted to buy.  
It was about &#165;55,000.</P> 
 
<P>I didn't know that Step has it's own showroom since the letters 
on the sign outside the door were only 10 inch high!&lt;g&gt;</P> 
 
<P>Tony showed us the entrance just beside of Step's entrance.  Well, 
you'll need to go inside the garage's drive-in and walk downstairs.  
Joe was missing, but was found inside Step writing down the 
prices of all models they had on display...</P> 
 
<P>Well, back to the basement showroom together with Joe: There you 
can see one of the neatest displays of electronic parts 
(everything clean).  The prices are not exactly rock-bottom, but 
you can jot down the parts you want, tell them, then get your 
custom-made machine 3 hours later!  I was looking for another 
<A HREF="http://www.wdc.com/">WD IDE</A> 1.6GB hard drive.  
&#165;39,000 wasn't what I wanted since A-Master advertised them for 
&#165;33,000.  I jotted the prices of their CPUs down, which I found 
cheap, but later on I discovered a shop that beat any shop between 
the North and South Pole!</P> 
 
<P>Out of the shop into the rain.  A short stop at JC-World yielded 
nothing new except overly excited young salesmen who shouted 
*irrashaimasseeee*.  Out of it and to the next store.</P>  
 
<P>Our American fellow was missing again!  Finally we found him still 
at JC-World jotting down prices...</P>  

<P>After 50 meters there was this Tsukumo #11 shop where the 
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jtinter/home.html">Japan Times</A> wrote
 about their dedicated and spacious 
"Internet Floor" with several computers to lay hands on.  The 
girl working at the street level didn't have a clue, but sent us 
in the wrong direction.  Finally we took the elevator (for midgets) 
up to the 5th floor.  Tony, Joseph, and I were ready to go, when a 
really pocket sized and slim Japanese wanted to come with 
us.  The warning buzzer sounded off, and he had to remove his 40 
or something kilograms ....</P> 
 
<P>5th floor Internet section: What a joke. There were three computers 
with one working model and an entirely unattractive browser on it.  
The shop must have bribed the Japan Times reporter, 
methinks.  Forget this shop in the near future!</P> 
 
<P>Next stop was the &quot;2nd hand street&quot; just before the Laox 
Computer Kan.  Not so many shops out in the street because of the 
rain.  The only highlight was the small T-Zone outlet at the end of 
the road.  If you are not too fussy about speed, what about a 
2X 7-disc CD-ROM changer for &#165;13,000 from 
<A HREF="http://www.nakamichi-corp.com:80/index.html">Nakamichi</A>?  This 
one requires SCSI.  Their hard disks are more expensive, but the 
display is great for advanced learners of English.  The shop carries 
special &quot;Quantam&quot; and &quot;Coneer&quot; hard drives.  I guess that this 
uniqueness justifies the higher prices...&lt;g&gt;  Our American 
friend got lost a couple of times, but we were always able to 
track him down.  Next time I'll make these guys smoke Indonesian 
clove cigarettes to sniff them out easily.  
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Cotton.Ken">Ken Cotton</A>
 couldn't 
sneak out last time... remember?&lt;g&gt;</P> 
 
<P>There was this <A HREF="http://www.epson.com/index.html">Epson</A> 
girl outside a shop who mistook Gabriel as 
Robert de Niro and me presumably his manager.  She insisted on taking 
a group photo of us with her digital camera, but finally there was 
only space for the two celebrities, however, Tony is clearly visible 
in the background.  Well, since Joseph made the girl entirely nervous, 
it took her awhile to remember the right steps to scan the image 
into the photo processing software.  Finally we got two prints done 
on a new Epson color printer.  The print costs &#165;37.  A normal instant 
camera yields sharper images and prints are cheaper, but the 
snapshots look pretty neat on the computer screen.</P> 
 
<P>I forgot, some minutes before we bumped into 
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Boyle.Todd">Todd Boyle</A>
 who was 
bitterly complaining that we were not at the station at 11:00.... 
He was on his way home with a new tower case in his hands.  What 
the guy really and dearly needs is a new wrist watch, methinks!&lt;g&gt;</P> 
 
<P>A short walk around the block got us to Laox Computer Kan.  The 
foreign book and magazine section has now partly been moved within 
the same floor.  It was 5 to 1 pm... time for lunch at the 1st 
floor restaurant of Akihabara's Department Store (belongs apparently 
to the COSMOS group, whose chairman is presently being indicted of 
skimming many billions of Yen).  Anyway, they didn't close down 
yet and we got what we had ordered.  Joe promised to join us a 
bit later since he had to &quot;check things out,&quot; he said.  Well, 
he didn't arrive until we headed down the staircase again.  Tony 
had to leave, and our quartet walked up to T-Zone in the Minami 
denki building.  Gabriel found his <A HREF="http://www.hp.com/">HP LaserJet</A> L5 
there for around &#165;50,000 (cheaper than at Step).</P> 
 
<P>In the 8th floor you can find cheaper computer models that aren't 
equipped with the newest Pentium chips.  Check it out since there 
are always some goodies available.  They had two brand-new 17-inch 
<A HREF="http://www.gw2k.com/">Gateway</A> 
monitors for &#165;39,800 in the shelf (no warranty).</P> 
 
<P>Occasionally we had to spent time to run and search for Joe 
American who was eagerly comparing prices until he found his 
bargain (an AST 133 computer with 17-inch monitor for a little less 
than &#165;300,000 I think).  Boy, was I happy about this one!  A 
sack full of fleas is easier keep together or at bay...&lt;g&gt;</P> 
 
<P>Next step was a trip to Robin's Garage (the one in the 4th 
floor!)...  When we stepped out of the elevator and opened the 
door, there was a showroom with all kinds of perfumes in the 
shelves!  Robin isn't anymore.  At least not in this hard to find 
place.  I guess that it was one of the worst business locations.  I 
have failed twice to find it initially.  The shop had no clue about 
the merit of putting a visible signboard outside the building.  
Besides, who is assuming that "Robin's Garage" is located on the 
4th floor at the back of a building?!  Well, that's the daily life 
in Akihabara I guess.</P> 
 
<P>After that we went to A-Master where I was supposed to buy my 
1.6GB hard drive for &#165;33,000, however, they were sold out.  Out of 
A-Master and up to the DOS/V Paradise CD-ROM shop.  There is hardly 
anything new since I was there a month ago.  Bundled encyclopedias 
like Compton and Grolier are too expensive for &#165;3,900.  I bought 
mine in this shop for &#165;1,500 a year ago.  We walked down to the 
lower floor (CD porno shop).  Joe asked whether the images feature 
the same dancing mosaics as the videos do.  Somebody said: &quot;Watch 
this TV...&quot;  What a great movie!  20% (the outer frame) was visible 
while the rest were lovely dancing mosaics.  Several months ago the 
shop was selling descrambling devices for &#165;20,000, but never connected 
them to the video to show how it works.</P> 
 
<P>This sucks...  Quickly out of the shop, but there was no go using the 
staircase.  It was barricaded with metal bars for some reason.  We 
needed to wait 5 minutes for the elevator to bring us down!</P>  

<P>Somebody (preferably a Japanese) ought to get the police involved.  Just 
imagine if a fire breaks out or an earthquake strikes!  I observed 
the same problem in the building where the Maha Poshya shop 
(the one which Aum's Asahara owned) was located.  They had stacked 
lots of boxes with monitors in the corner where the door was supposed 
to be.  I didn't know that there was any door in the beginning...  
Anyway, we got down safely.</P> 

<P>Joe and Gabriel wanted to buy their gadgets, so we ended our trip 
and said good bye.  I carried on with 
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Nortey.Joseph">Joseph Nortey</A>
 who needed some 
ZIP floppies.  Two-Top had the cheapest ones for &#165;1,750.  Other shops 
wanted between &#165;1,900 and &#165;2,680.</P>
 
<P>Then we walked up the long staircase to &quot;Za Graceful&quot; where I 
decided to buy my 1.6GB WD (Caviar) hard drive.  &#165;30,680 can't be 
beat.  This is cheaper than most places which advertise in the 
Computer Shopper!  The shop has the cheapest memory in town also.  
BTW, this shop is in the same street as the DOS/V Paradise 
computer showroom (on the same side of the street).</P>

<P>Whole computer systems (166Mhz, 32MB, 512K SRAM, 1.6GB) are 
&#165;30,000 less than exactly the same configuration (and parts) at 
DOS/V Paradise.</P> 
 
<P>Here I split up with Joseph and popped into a another shop where I 
saw the HP LaserJet L5 for &#165;44,500.  Gabriel might have already bought 
his for &#165;5,000 more at T-Zone...  When I headed back to the station, 
Gabriel bumped into me again.  He didn't buy yet, so I gave him the
name card of the shop which I had secured for &quot;just in case&quot;.  
I have no follow up, but I really think that he went for this one.</P> 
 
<P>Then I saw this hawker who looks like a homeless person and usually 
&quot;opens&quot; his shop in front of a closed store shutter.  There were 3 
big cardboard boxes with various game cartridges for the Sega 
Megadrive game computer for &#165;100 each, many CD-ROMs and other 
software.  I watched two American tourists browsing 
through the software who held the only copy of Mad Dog McCree 
and Aladdin and The Wonderful Lamp in their hands.  The huge 
sticker on the shrink-wrap said DOS/V....</P> 
 
<P>Since the poor guys were at a total loss, nice as I am, I 
immediately helped out by saying that this meant 
compatibility with the Japanese operating system (which is 
actually true).  The guys thanked me for the good advice, put 
the software packages back into the box and left.  5 seconds later I 
grabbed both, paid &#165;500 each, and went straight to the station and 
home to go for the kill on my plain DOS/Windows system...&lt;BG&gt;</P>
