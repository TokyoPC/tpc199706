<H1>Ionic Column</H1>
<P>
<H2>by David Parry</H2>
<HR>
<H4>Englishman David Parry lived in Tokyo from 1980 to 1994 and was 
a member of TPC from 1986. A frequent contributor to this publication, 
he was Newsletter Publisher from late 1988 to early 1990 and 
began the Ionic Column in 1992. This column has won a prize and 
an honorable mention in newsletter awards. To the Tokyo BBS community, 
he now lives in virtual cyberspace and teleports textually over the 
ether. On the physical level, he currently lives and works in Düsseldorf, 
that part of Germany that most resembles Japan.</H4> 
 

<H2>CeBIT 96</H2>
<H2>Hanover</H2>
 
<P>It was time again to head out in the chill Rhenish dawn and to head 
into the chill Hanoverian mists in the double-decker Panzerbus. The 
CeBIT 96 trip was under way, organized by a local bookshop, and I was all 
agog to explore the brave new European computing world. As agog as one 
can be after starting at 07:00, anyway.</P> 
 
<P>Hanover is spelt with a double 'n' in English, for some reason, but 
I'll stick to the English version for the sake of my readers and my 
ever-vigilant spelling checker. One 'n' or two, Hanover was still 
very much in the grip of winter, with small patches of snow visible 
even just outside the show grounds, and betraying a Siberian influence. 
Or was it a portent? This year CeBIT had a number of exhibitors from 
eastern Europe.</P> 
 
<P>CeBIT is the premier computer show in Europe, and it must be said 
that it is too big. I jetted down the aisles with a quick glance 
to left and right, stopped as briefly and as infrequently as I could, 
stopped for brief nourishment only, and still only covered six 
halls out of a total of 19 in 7 1/2 hours. It's big. The halls 
are bigger than those at Harumi, and the Data Show seemed to 
shrink a bit after about 1990, as I recall.</P> 

<P>There are sections in CeBIT that are frankly irrelevant, with two 
halls devoted to banking and financial products. I passed through 
fairly large sections in two of the halls that i covered which 
were devoted to products specifically for biggish companies or 
government administration, one hall was primarily dedicated 
to computer-aided manufacturing, and some of the networking and 
telecommunications displays were for hard-core devotees only. 
(I had no time for the latter this year, unlike last time.) But 
if you took those away, you still have more than ten large halls—each 
as big or bigger than the big dome at Harumi—or the mainstream 
products. It's too much! Nor were they grouped very logically. Nor 
do you get a leaflet that gives a meaningful overview; you either 
get a sketchy map (free) or have to fork out for a heavy and bulky 
directory.</P> 
 
<H3>The wetware...</H3>
 
<P>But what was there? This time I concentrated on software, but 
excluding network-related products. I covered the halls that 
featured all the big-name vendors, who were mainly selling their 
hardware. I merely glanced at them, and can confirm that there were 
no really interesting costumes this year. The Olympia stand featured 
a refugee apiece from Starlight Express and Cats, and later in the 
day I saw a sweet young thing standing on a chair and having her 
legs painted in black and white in readiness for her presentation. 
I debated whether to offer gentlemanly help, with the emphasis on 
the manly, but chickened out.</P> 
 
 
<H3>The hardnosed-ware...</H3> 
 
<P>Back to computers, you say? If you insist. My first port of call 
was Deutsche Telekom, monopolistic purveyor of over-priced 
telecommunications services to a long-suffering and distinctly 
unhappy German public. This was my first chance to put all kinds 
of nasty questions to the poor things manning and womanning the 
booths. I was polite, but I gave Telekom both barrels; what was the 
actual pricing of ISDN, including ad-on hardware? What was involved? 
How much did it costs? What about the things I had heard about 
Telekom being deluged with requests for help in getting ISDN up 
and running, and the lack of engineers with suitable knowledge? And 
yes, I knew all about their much-touted special offers for ISDN 
installations up to the end of June, but I also knew that their 
monopoly on the German telecommunications market expired at the end 
of the year, and what were the prognoses for that? I left with the 
feeling hat I might as well wait a bit longer, as prices could 
only drop, the hardware get better and cheaper, and the engineers 
would have more experience.</P> 
 
 
<H3>The ISDN where?</H3> 
 
<P>While it would be worth thinking of ISDN if I was installing 
two new lines -- and that would be the case if I decide to work 
from home, I don't see a compelling reason to change over just now. 
I'll wait and see what 1997 brings. I do, however, have the feeling 
that ISDN works well enough if you buy the right hardware and if 
you don't try to get too fancy with the configuration. Overall, I 
think that is why Richard Boomgaarden had the troubles I quoted a 
month or two back.</P>

<H3>The glareware...</H3>
 
<P>The next place I visited, coincidentally, was 
<A HREF="http://www.polaroid.com">Polaroid</A>. 
I glanced at them, wondering if screen cameras had dropped to a reasonable 
price yet, when my eye was caught by a display of screen filters. I 
was unimpressed at first, since every shop in Japan has them and 
the vast majority are not very effective. I used a fabric one 
on the amber monitor of my first PC and the coarse mesh was 
obtrusive, and the glass ones tend to add glare and reflections. 
The Polaroid one looked better. Also, the attachment method was 
more secure than the average, with a frame that goes all round the 
bezel of the monitor. I thought they would be outrageously 
expensive, but the one I was looking at was a much more affordable 
model, at just over 100 DM (about $70) for 14-inch to 15-inch monitors.</P> 
 
<P>I quote from the brochure: &quot;The circular polarizer is the key 
component in all Polaroid CP-Filters. And, it's the component 
that sets them apart from other types of anti-glare products. By 
combining a two layer circular polarizer with optical quality 
materials and multi-layer optical coating, Polaroid CP-Filters are as 
much as 12 times more effective in fighting computer glare than 
other kinds of filters. And, they're as much as 14 times more 
effective at enhancing contrast for better screen clarity and 
sharpness. The difference is immediate and dramatic.&quot; They go 
on to say &quot;All sizes include an electrically conductive coating 
for static control and up to 98% reduction of VLF/ELF electric 
field radiation.&quot;</P> 
 
<P>Wary as I am of these sorts of claims, I will say that the filter 
does a very creditable job and I will get one for myself. The 
Smile monitor that I have now is reasonably good at preventing 
glare, but I always get reflections off the windows and the lights.</P> 
 
<P>Nihonjin and gaijin alike can find Nippon Polaroid in the Mori 
Building No. 30 in Toranomon, and, if your existing screen does 
not reflect too badly, surf the Net 
to <A HREF="http://www.polaroid.com">http://www.polaroid.com</A>.</P> 
 
<H3>The bugware...</H3> 
 
<P>Last year I had picked up a demo diskette for 
<A HREF="http://www.thunderbyte.com/home.html">ThunderByte</A> anti-virus 
software which I reviewed last year. This year I looked in vain 
for ThunderByte, but I ran into a couple of rivals. 
<A HREF="http://www.sands.com/">Dr. Solomon</A> had a 
booth, from which I extracted a brochure and read swiftly while 
marching onwards. Rated number 1 overall in anti-virus software, 
and top of several categories, this was a product to consider. So 
what had happened to poor ThunderByte?</P> 
 
<P>Not far away was the Australian section. A thought bubble must 
have been visible above head; since when has the rest of the 
world heard of anything computer-related from Australia. To quote 
an article from, I think, Datamation in about 1984, &quot;the 
Australians think a spreadsheet is something you put on the ground 
for a picnic.&quot; My head full of ethnic slurs, I ambled past the 
booths and noticed one called &quot;Leprechaun Software.&quot; Had I 
perhaps overshot and progressed in one kangaroo-like leap to 
Ireland? No, this was an Australian company, although the 
younger of the two sales reps had a very Irish look about him, nay, 
almost leprechaun-like.</P> 
 
<P>Still pondering the Dr. Solomon leaflet, I asked sweetly if they 
had any comparative reviews from computer magazines. &quot;No, we 
don't,&quot; came the reply, &quot;since the tests are often misleading. 
They don't say which viruses they tested with, or how many, or 
how many false alarms there were. If you want a real-life 
reference, we are used by several branches of the Australian 
government.&quot; I pondered further: I was not aware that the 
Australians, governmental or otherwise, were security 
fanatics. But after talking with them some more, it became 
obvious that they were very serious about their product and 
on-going support, and that they were confident that it 
performed well in a real-world setting.</P> 
 
<P>Virus Buster is produced by 
<A HREF="http://www.leprechaun.com.au/">Leprechaun Software</A> Pty 
Ltd. of P.O. Box 826, 
Capalaba, Queensland 4157, 
Australia. Software from Queensland? If the virii have not 
struck down your PC fax, call +61-7-3823-1233 for more info. If 
your browser is still in good health, try len@leprechaun.com.au. 
Virus Buster was quoted at around $150. Oztralian dollars, that is.</P> 
 
<P>CeBIT was too big to cover in a day, or in a single column. Stay 
tuned for part two.</P> 
 
<P>Next month: more of CeBIT, including: building a better 
mouse (no trap); competition for Lantastic; 
Maxed out on Qualitas; from Russia with software; and, 
Bitstream lives! In a future column, I will also 
comment on machine translation software.</P>
