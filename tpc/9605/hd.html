<H1>Hard Disk Crash!</H1>
<P>
<H2>by Ben Sherman</H2>
<HR>
<P>My hard disk crashed recently.  I want to tell you what happened and what I 
learned that can benefit you.</P>   
 
<P>At home I have a <A HREF="http://www.intel.com/">Pentium</A> 90 MHz IBM-compatible computer that I use for much of my work.  
In December I started getting 'lost cluster' messages every time I'd boot up the 
computer. <A HREF="http://www.symantec.com/">Norton Utilities</A> would automatically scan my hard disk for viruses and other 
unwanted problems. One of  the problems it would detect was lost clusters.  I would opt 
to fix them, then I would start running Windows and Word, and all the other stuff I 
use on a regular  basis. A month later I started to get other error messages.  Some 
of them I could understand, some of them meant nothing to me. I received 
<B>&quot;Failure on INT 24&quot;</B> several times, 
<B>&quot;expanded memory not present or not usable&quot;</B> once 
or twice, and  then more ominous messages like <B>&quot;This application has violated system 
integrity due to an invalid page fault and will be terminated.  Quit all applications, 
quit Windows, and then restart your computer.&quot;</B> At least the last one I could read. 
I  didn't know what an invalid page fault was, but I did know how to follow the 
advice and restart the computer.</P> 
  
<P>Okay, so something was up. I thought about viruses. I rarely received diskettes 
from anywhere, or anyone. I had not installed any new software, except for a 
game or two from the TPC BBS, so I was pretty certain it wasn't a virus. Nonetheless, 
I used the MS-AntiVirus software that comes in DOS, 
the <A HREF="http://www.mcafee.com/">McAfee Scandisk</A> software, 
and some software from <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</A>. All of it came up blank. 
&quot;No virus detected.&quot;</P> 
 
<P>I suddenly had this strange feeling, like, &quot;better back up all your papers NOW Ben&quot;. 
I have learned to follow gut feelings, especially with illogical things like my 
computer. So I formatted a few floppy disks and started to 
use <A HREF="http://www.pkware.com/">Pkzip</A> to zip 
up all  the files I wrote that I did not want to lose. This meant going into 
File Manager and then into Word and going through all my directories one at a 
time, zipping the files up and transferring them to floppies. This took about an 
hour. This was added insurance to supplement the files I already had backed up the 
previous week on my <A HREF="http://www.hp.com/">Colorado</A> Travan tape 
drive. I thought to myself &quot;what happens if the tape drive doesn't work? I can 
always reinstall the software, but if I lose all my letters, research papers, 
student grades, artwork, scanned newspaper articles, etc. I will really be in 
trouble.&quot; Sure enough, just as I finished zipping the last of the irreplaceable 
files onto the fifth floppy, my hard disk crashed.</P> 
 
<P>First I tried the Norton Utilities Rescue disk, and received the 
following message:</P> 
 
<P><B>&quot;Sector not found reading drive C:<BR> 
Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?&quot;</B></P> 
 
<P>I chose &quot;Fail&quot; which then brought me out of Windows to DOS and to the 
following message:</P> 
 
<P><B>&quot;error estOO10: physical EOF before logical EOF on . RTL.<BR> 
Invalid command.com<BR> 
Cannot load command.co<BR>  
system halted.&quot;</B></P> 
 
<P>Uh oh. I was never into est myself, but I could understand &quot;invalid command.com.&quot; 
That last one meant that when I tried to restart my computer, it wasn't going to. 
Which it didn't. I pulled out my emergency DOS boot disk, inserted it into 
drive A:, and booted up. This worked, but when I tried to get to drive C: I 
received the following message:</P> 
 
<P><B>&quot;invalid media type reading drive C: abort, retry, fail?&quot;</B></P> 
 
<P>Big time uh-oh. Back to Norton Utilities. I booted up again with their 
Rescue Utilities and started using their various rescue programs. Unerase found 
lots of  gobbledygook, all of it looking like extended ASCII characters. Unformat 
was able to rescue 2 clusters out of 1.2 gigabytes. So much for &quot;rescuing my  
programs.&quot; I called around to a few computer genius-types who I considered 
higher up the ladder of enlightenment than myself. People listened and 
gave their advice. 
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Ryan.Kevin">Kevin Ryan</A>
 said that the FAT errors I had gotten earlier 
indicated that I would have to repartition my hard disk.</P> 
 
<P>I have had enough experience with computers to realize that I had two 
choices: either agonize over all the various ways to get my computer up and 
running, try all my friends' computer folk remedies, and spend days or weeks in 
the process, or I could do a surgical strike. This is often the quickest and 
easiest thing to do. It involved reformatting my hard disk and losing what data 
was not backed up. I opted for the strike. I reformatted the disk, reinstalled 
Windows, and then restored my backed up programs using the Colorado tape drive. 
This took about four hours. Everything seemed to work.</P> 
 
<P>I got back on the BBS downloaded my e-mail, wrote some replies, and then the 
computer crashed again. Okay, repeat virus checks. Repeat DOS Scandisk. Ah-ha! 
Something new here. My newly reformatted hard disk seems to have more than 
730 megabytes of bad sectors. Now why did MS-DOS knowingly format bad sectors? 
Beats me. But this means that much of the information that resides on those bad 
sectors is probably corrupted. I need to change the hard disk. But I also need the 
computer.</P>  

<P>Actually this happened the week before final exams at my school, meaning that I 
really, really needed the computer. So, what the heck, another surgical strike. 
But this time I had learned something: DOS does not recognize bad sectors during 
the format process. The labeling of bad sectors during the formatting process 
seems like common sense to a lay user like myself. Why should an operating system 
be able to format bad sectors? I had believed that the formatting process fixed 
bad sectors. I guess not.</P> 
 
<P>Norton Utilities has a program called Disk Doctor that will check the surface 
of the hard disk and diagnose bad sectors. Microsoft Scandisk seems to be the 
same kind of program. The reason I prefer the Norton is because it has an 
&quot;automatic mark bad sector&quot; option. With my hard disk of 1.2 gigabytes, this 
means that I don't have to sit in front of the computer and continually press 
the Enter key for every one of the bad sectors that comprise the more than 
730 megabytes of bad sector space on my hard disk. That's a useful option.</P> 
 
<P>Okay, reformat, part two. This time I did it differently. I used MS-DOS to 
reformat the hard disk. Then I installed the Norton Utilities and used the 
above-mentioned Disk Doctor to check the surface of the disk. Whammo! It marked 
the same 730 megabytes of hard disk as bad sectors. With the bad sectors marked 
so that data could not be written to them, I installed Windows, Office, and my 
other software. Then I restored what I wanted from my tape drive. Next, I set 
up all the directories the way I wanted them to be. This entire process took the 
better part of a Sunday, but by evening I was up and running again.</P> 
  
<P>What I learned that you can do:</P> 
 
<H3>1. Back everything up</H3> 

<P>Get into the habit of backing everything up religiously. This involves two actions 
on your part. One, buying a tape or MO back-up device, and two, actually using 
it on a scheduled basis. I have a Colorado Travan tape drive. I purchased it at a 
computer store in the United States and brought it back with me last summer. 
It can store 400 megabytes of uncompressed data or almost 800 megabytes compressed. 
It cost under $200. It is an internal device. I had to install it myself, and I am 
not joking when I say that it came with the best instructions I have ever seen. 
Installation was painless. I would buy another one in a minute. You should buy one 
that can hold at least 500 megabytes compressed. It came with its own software 
which was also very self-explanatory.</P> 
 
<P>The problem is using it regularly. Because there is no immediate gratification, 
I suspect I am like many other people who make a few backups, and then quickly 
fall out of the habit. You have to view it as life insurance you can use. You buy 
life insurance because you have to protect your family. You know you need to buy 
the best, but you also know that you yourself will never benefit. A back-up device 
is much the same. You buy it because you have to protect your data. However, when 
your hard disk crashes, you yourself will benefit. Therefore, you have to push 
yourself to use the back-up device, if not every day, then at least once a week.</P> 
 
<P>Remember that when you begin to see frequent error messages, or when the 
Norton Utilities begins to report &quot;lost clusters&quot; you should get the hint that 
something is wrong somewhere and that your chances of computer failure are 
increasing. This is the time that you want to make a special backup of all very  
important files on floppy disks, just in case your tape drive fails.</P> 
 
<H3>2. Make a soft box.</H3> 

<P>This is what I call the box where I store my original installation diskettes. This 
box also holds the corresponding installation manuals and other odds-and-ends. Mine 
has the following essential diskettes and manuals: DOS, Windows, my CD-ROM driver 
diskette, my mouse driver diskette, my video card diskettes, my Norton Utilities 
diskettes, the Colorado tape drive software and my communications software. It 
also contains my motherboard manual, and receipt for my computer. The rest of the 
software diskettes lie in computer diskette boxes under one of my tables. Most 
of the manuals lie on a bookshelf.</P>  

<P>Print out all important files, meaning your <B>autoexec.bat</B>, <B>config.sys</B>, 
<B>win.ini</B>, and <B>sys.ini</B> files.  Put the date on the printout and put it 
into the soft box.</P> 
 
<H3>3. Use Print Screen</H3> 

<P>Record some information about how your desktop is set up in case you have to 
reinstall. For example, suppose I want to record all the names of all the 
directories on my hard disk. An easy way to do this is to open File Manager and 
then press the &quot;Print Screen&quot; button on your keyboard. Next, open the Paintbrush  
program. Under Edit, select &quot;Paste&quot; and then under File, select &quot;Print.&quot; This will 
print a picture of your screen showing your File Manager with all of its 
directories. Do the same with Program Manager. Put these two papers into your 
soft box.</P> 
 
<H3>4. Buy original software.</H3> 

<P>There are several reasons I mention this. Unless you have money to spare, you 
probably have several pirated programs residing on your hard disk. You got them 
from a friend, from the office, or from Hong Kong or Thailand. You probably don't 
have the manuals. The quality of original diskettes is usually superior to that 
of copied ones. When you use originals, you know that all the files exist on the 
disk, and if they don't, you can easily receive replacements. With pirated copies, 
you never know if you have all the files you need. When your hard disk fails, you 
want your software to install painlessly. Copied installation diskettes often fail 
for reasons I won't discuss here.</P> 
 
<P>One of the other nice advantages of original software is that you get the manuals. 
Space consuming as they are, a manual will tell you how to do things that might 
not be intuitive just from looking at the screen. Often a program will have short-cut 
keys that will be described in the manual. A manual is a reference book. It may not 
be terribly lucid sometimes, but it is all written down on paper. It doesn't crash, 
nor does it require electricity to read.</P> 
  
<P>By far the best reason for buying original software are the help-lines maintained 
by the software companies. In the past, you could call up a company, tell them you 
were using their software and ask for help. Now, companies are cutting costs and 
technical support. They expect you to have proof of ownership, as in a registration 
number on hand when you call them.  I advise copying the registration number onto 
the front of your first installation diskette, and onto the front cover of your 
manuals. You don't want to be fumbling in the bottom of your closet or through the 
mess in your desk drawers for a number on a card that you are not even sure you 
still have. Without that number, they will refuse to speak to you.</P> 
 
<H3>5. Use a highlighter pen</H3> 

<P>I also advise you to make liberal use of a highlighter marking pen. Mark up your 
manuals. Use a marker to highlight the special options you will need to use should 
you have to reinstall your software.</P>  

<P>This came in handy for me last week when I had to reinstall my communications 
software. There were settings that I couldn't easily remember without laboriously 
looking them up. These included the exact type of modem I have, the technical name 
for it, and the COM Port it was set to. There were also help-line numbers, product 
registration numbers, and other small details that once high-lighted greatly increased 
their accessibility.</P> 
 
<H3>6. Install several virus checkers</H3> 

<P>Because you usually do not know what the real cause of your problem is, software 
or hardware failure, a virus, or simply your own mistake, the best solution is to 
address all four systematically, one at a time. I use the virus checker that came 
with MS-DOS, and McAfee VirusScan, and a Japanese program that someone gave me. 
I use several because no virus checker can cover everything. I hope that they 
complement each other. However, as prepared as I advise you to be, I think that much 
of the hysteria over viruses is overblown in the media because it makes such 
interesting news stories. With that said, I would like to note that in the last 
two years I have caught and eradicated two viruses, FORM and AntiCMOS, twice each. 
Only in a single instance was a virus on my computer, and that time it came on a 
diskette that my wife had used at Temple University.</P> 
 
<P>Computer code and viruses are involved in a symbiotic struggle: What one man can 
invent, another man can break... which another man can then fix. You and I are the 
users of the first and third party's products, and indirectly of the second man's 
products, in the form of improved software.</P> 
 
<H3>7. Join a computer club</H3> 

<P>You need a network of knowledgeable people to access in times of trouble. A club 
is a bank of knowledge. Sometimes you deposit information, sometimes you withdraw. 
You cannot learn everything there is to know about computers, but by becoming 
involved in a club, you gain access to a large number of people who together have 
experienced most of the problems you will ever face. A club has other obvious 
benefits including ongoing educational, social, and recreational activities. And 
as time goes on you too will be consulted by less-experienced members.</P> 
 
<H3>8. Buy a fast machine</H3> 

<P>Buy as fast a machine as you can afford. At school I have a 386 computer on my desk 
with 6 megabytes of RAM. It runs all my Windows applications slowly, but just fine. 
I have no problems using Word, Excel, Paintbrush, or any educational software. For 
my everyday purposes, the processor speed is not very important... how fast can I 
really type? The problem comes when I want to install software on the 386 or on 
its sister machines that I have set up for students in a self-access lab. The 
installation time of DOS and Windows on a 386 is slightly over thirty minutes. 
Multiply that by thirty machines and you start to have a major headache, even 
without the inevitable installation problems that always crop up. I am impatient 
about my time. I don't want to wait while the machine installs software, 
spell-checks a document, saves to the hard disk, adds some numbers, backs up my data, 
or performs a myriad of other functions. A fast machine with ample RAM reduces 
the amount of time I spend waiting for the hourglass to go away.</P> 
 
<P>I cannot control the speed of the machines at my school. I can only use them as a 
benchmark for comparison with my home Pentium (i.e., 586) computer which has 12 
megabytes of RAM. Installation of the same software takes less than ten minutes. 
Printing is a breeze. There is never any hourglass telling me to wait for access 
to the CPU. A fast machine will reduce the waiting time you spend in front of the 
computer, and will give you more time to do the things you really want to do.</P> 
 
<H3>9. Reinstall everything once a year</H3> 

<P>I try to clean my real desk several times a year; my wife wishes that I would clean 
it every day, or even dispense with it entirely. A computer is a virtual desk. It 
gets cluttered and disorganized just as your real desk does. As a computer is a 
thinking tool, clutter reduces its efficiency to help you think.  Do you really 
need that 1,000-font package you bought on the trip home? Isn't it time you finally 
deleted Doom?</P>  

<P>Maybe now is the time to start the final migration away from those old DOS programs. 
Are you ever going to use those three word processors? I recommend backing up all 
important files, reformatting the hard disk, then using a program like Norton 
Utilities Disk Doctor to mark any bad sectors of the disk, and finally reinstalling 
all your software once a year. It'll take a day to complete. The free time around 
New Year's or Golden Week might be a good time for this as everybody is cleaning 
everything anyway. Why not clean the  computer once a year?</P>
