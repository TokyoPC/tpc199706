<P>Those of you who read last month's issue may remember that
I was having trouble with The Beast, 
my <A HREF="http://www.gw2k.com">Gateway 2000</A> P5-66 computer,
and planning to make some changes in my setup, hoping to
(no snickering, please) rationalize it a bit. Well, I've had somewhat spotty 
success.</P>

<P>A suggestion from 
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Lipton.Charlie">Charlie Lipton</A>
 fixed my floppy drive's problems:
I stuck the thin attachment of my vacuum cleaner into the drive door
(gently), turned on the vacuum cleaner, and <I>Voila!</I>, problem solved.
 I wish they were all that easy to deal with.</P>

<P>Installing the <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</A> 2.1GB drive was dead simple.
  Win95 scanned for new hardware and found it, the SCSI utilities worked fine, I got it partitioned into two 1GB virtual drives with
 no problem...the whole thing probably took only about 20 minutes or so,
 unless you count the time I spent going out to buy a new SCSI cable,
 since the old one lacked sufficient connectors. I removed my 
old <A HREF="http://www.hp.com:80/cms/index.htm">Colorado
</A> 250MB tape drive, even though I didn't really have to, having found 
another space for the new hard disk drive. The Colorado had been left in 
place after I installed a new <A HREF="http://www.conner.com">Conner
</A> Travan tape drive, but it wasn't connected any more, so while I had 
The Beast open, I pulled it out.  So far so good, but when I checked the 
system I found that I had a new problem.</P>

<P>My <A HREF="http://www.pinnaclemicro.com/tahoe230.html">Pinnacle</A> Tahoe 
MO drive (into which I had carefully transferred a lot of little-used data 
and programs) is no longer responding. It's in a permanent &quot;not ready&quot; state, 
and although it powers up OK, it doesn't respond properly.  Don't know why, 
and I'm not exactly a happy camper because of it, either.  I haven't had the
 anticipated time to deal with this during Golden Week so far, and it's a 
relatively minor problem when compared to a non-functioning floppy drive.</P>

<P>Maybe the problem will spontaneously disappear when I get around to 
upgrading my BIOS, as soon as I finish this issue of the <I>AJ</I>. I probably 
should have done this before installing the new HDD, since one of the features 
of the new BIOS is apparently the ability to deal with drives bigger than a 
gig, but I'm anxious about doing a BIOS upgrade with the <I>AJ</I> deadline 
close.  Who knows what catastrophes might ensue?  (Think I'm getting paranoid? 
Read on...)</P>

<P>Another problem I've noticed recently, as I use Win95 more and more, is that 
it seems <A HREF="http://www.mustang.com">OLX</A> isn't working right when I 
access it under Win95. I'm using the DOS version of the OLX mail reader, which 
I got in my DOS version of <A HREF="http://mustang.com">QModemPro</A>, but I'm 
using QModemPro for Windows, and the version of that which I bought didn't 
include OLX. It's always worked well under Windows 3.11 in a DOS shell, but 
for some reason when I use it under Win95 the reply packets it prepares are 
perceived by BBSs as being in an &quot;unknown format&quot;.  The same packets seem 
perfectly fine when I upload them using QModemPro in a Win3.11 environment, 
though.  It's a mystery to me why this should be, and even whether this is the 
fault of OLX or QModemPro.</P>

<P>No doubt I wouldn't have this problem if I upgraded to a Win95 version 
communications program, but 1) I'm far from rich, 2) I still haven't adjusted 
to the way my salary is paid under the new system at work (considerably 
smaller monthly salary, much larger bonuses), 3) the next bonus isn't until 
late June, and 4) I do have other things on which to spend my disposable income.,</P>

<P>I also recently discovered that my joystick won't work under Win95. It's 
connected to my sound board, which is a 
Gateway-provided <A HREF="http://ctlsg.ctlsgcreat.com">Creative Labs</A> 
SoundBlaster 16 (I think; it might be a SoundBlaster Pro...it's a little hard 
to tell, but that's another story).  The sound board works fine, and Win95
 recognizes that there's a joystick attached, but although I
 believe that I've loaded the newest drivers, I can't get the
 joystick to work.  This is not a really serious problem, though,
 since <A HREF="http://www.activision.com">Activision
</A>'s MechWarrior 2 tends to crash very quickly anyway,
 that's the only game I have which can only be played under Win95,
 and I wasn't going to have much time to play games until
 sometime next year, anyway.</P>

<P>By that time, I'll probably have upgraded to a new computer. With its own 
share of problems, no doubt.</P>

<P>I've bought another couple of Win95 programs recently, but I'll
 talk about those next issue, after I've had a chance to really
 try them out.  Maybe by then I'll have solved some of my current
 problems, too.</P>
