<HR>
<H4>Englishman David Parry lived in Tokyo from 1980 to 1994 and was 
a member of TPC from 1986. A frequent contributor to this publication, 
he was Newsletter Publisher from late 1988 to early 1990 and 
began the Ionic Column in 1992. This column has won a prize and 
an honorable mention in newsletter awards. To the Tokyo BBS community, 
he now lives in virtual cyberspace and teleports textually over the 
ether. On the physical level, he currently lives and works in D&uuml;sseldorf, 
that part of Germany that most resembles Japan.</H4> 

<H2>CeBIT 96 - Hanover</H2> 
 
<H3>Part Two</H3> 
 
<P>Oh my poor feet, or, the rest of the day at CeBIT 96</P> 
 
<P>In the last column I reported on some of the items I saw at CeBIT 96 back in 
the middle of March. In part two I continue with some other points of interest. 
Again, I did not manage to see more than a quarter of CeBIT, and perhaps half 
of what I would have liked to have seen. I did not get to see much of new PCs 
or peripherals such as printers, on the basis that magazine reviews are more 
helpful anyway. Nor was there time.</P> 
 
<H3>Aristocratic Networking</H3> 
 
<P>Peer to peer networking is nothing to do with old school ties and the old boy 
net at the House of Lords, but simply means that you can link up PCs directly to 
each other without going through a central controller or server. For the record, 
<A HREF="http://www.novell.com/">Novell Netware</A> is exactly the opposite, 
being entirely server-based, and PC faxes or modems can only function over a 
Novell network if you dedicate a PC to them to act as a dedicated server. 
(My Castelle FaxPress is in effect a small PC with no keyboard, monitor or 
compatibility problems, having no more than a motherboard with fax circuitry, 
the network interface circuitry and connector, and a couple of big lights to 
provide a great show on startup.)</P> 
 
<H3>Station to Station</H3> 
 
<P><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Windows 95</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.austin.ibm.com/pspinfo/os2.html">OS/2 Warp Connect</A> can 
act as peer to peer networks. Add a network interface card (NIC) to each PC and 
whatever type of cabling is best suited to your budget and the distances involved, 
and voila! In a way, peer to peer networking is a better substitute for null 
modem connections and <A HREF="http://www.travsoft.com/products/">LapLink</A>, 
although it costs more to set up initially.</P> 
 
 
<H3>Lantastic</H3> 
 
<P>The main entrant is peer to peer networking 
is <A HREF="http://www.artisoft.com/">Artisoft</A>, with Lantastic. I used the 
program at the end of my time in Tokyo, and found it relatively easy to set up. 
Setting up printers was a cinch, especially compared to trying to get a Netware 
print server to function, but it got progressively more tedious to add 
new users, as each station had to be cross-referenced. The current version may 
not be so onerous. Also, Lantastic 5.0 and a mixed bag of Gateway PCs and Windows 
turned out to be a less than happy mix. We also discovered that if one PC crashed, 
the others were affected. That particular little buglet may or may not 
have been fixed by now.</P> 
 
<H3>Personal Net Where?</H3> 
 
<P>Novell offered Personal Netware as an alternative to Lantastic, but it seems to 
have been quietly ignored by all, and especially Novell. One other contestant 
in peer to peer networking was at CeBIT. Desk to Desk is produced by CBIS, and 
I found them at CeBIT at a stand for the state of Georgia.</P> 
 
<H3>Desk to Desk</H3> 
 
<P>The Desk to Desk salespersons persevered, even when I said I was already 
running a Novell network. I took a look at the product, asked them some 
awkward questions, and finally walked off with a leaflet. I offer the 
following on the basis of that alone, and without any actual hands-on experience.</P> 
 
<P>Desk to Desk is rather like what Lantastic used to be, meaning &quot;cheap.&quot; The 
comparison prices quoted list Lantastic at $238 for 2 (!) users and $595 for 5 
users, the latter being close to the street price for Netware 3.12. Desk to 
Desk is $129 for up to 255 users. That's what I call reasonable. The product 
has the usual peer to peer features, such as security and printer sharing, and 
the ability to designate a PC as a file server or a print server if you wish. 
It is the sort of thing you start wishing for, when you don't know which 
PC has the latest version of a file, or if your PC is the one with the printer 
and regularly slows to a crawl when somebody prints.</P>  
 
<P>CBIS did admit that you can't use faxmodems on other PCs, but they plan to add 
the feature. They did say that my Castelle could probably work on their system 
by using NetBIOS calls. Without actual testing, I can't say either what happens 
to the rest of the network if one PC crashes.</P>  
 
<P>At the price, Desk to Desk certainly is worth looking at. You even get a 
30 day no-questions-asked refund guarantee.</P>

<H3><A HREF="http://www.bitstream.com/">Bitstream</A> Lives!</H3> 
 
<P>Bitstream ceased to be visible to me after they ceased to bundle their fonts. 
<A HREF="http://www.hp.com/">H-P</A> used Bitstream Courier 
in the LJ II, but spurned it for the spindly <A HREF="http://www.agfa.com/">Agfa</A> 
Compugraphic version for the LJ III and 4. I don't recall seeing Bitstream fonts 
being bundled with programs after the GEM version 
of <A HREF="http://www.corel.ca/">Ventura Publisher</A>, Signature and XyWrite 4. 
<A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</A> gained more visibility by reducing 
the price of Post Script for printers -- my LJ 4 has it -- and making their 
fonts much cheaper. But Bitstream has not disappeared.</P> 
 
<P>They still have fonts, lots of fonts, and indeed they have a CD-ROM with 500 
fonts on it. The selection includes many fonts already widely available as 
standard PostScript or TrueType offerings, and all fonts are available in both 
those two forms and without further unlocking.  But these days cheap TrueType 
fonts are a dime a thousand on CD-ROM. What was interesting was that they are 
working on what I might term &quot;worldwide&quot; fonts.</P>  
 
<P>Cyberbit is an international font that includes the typographic characters 
for most of the world's major languages. This includes double-byte languages 
such as Japanese. Cyberbit is Unicode 1.1-compliant for Windows NT and supports 
all the code pages in Windows 95. The initial release will include approx. 
8,500 characters, and the Roman weight will be distributed free of charge by 
Bitstream. I don't know which font it is based on, but my guess it is based on 
Bitstream Swiss, a.k.a. Helvetica. This would make it possible to have a more 
unified look in one document when using romaji, kana and kanji, allowing for the 
differences between pictograms and alphabets or syllabaries.</P> 
 
<P>Cyberbit is intended to make documents readable by anyone throughout the world, 
and Bitstream is looking primarily at the Internet for its target market. In 
short, Cyberbit will allow Web users to create and read documents in any 
language, since the accented characters will always show up at the other end 
if the reader also have the Cyberbit font (and a double-byte browser or 
application, if need be).</P>  

<P>I also collected brochures for their non-Latin typefaces and Asian typefaces. The 
former covers Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic and Farsi, the former has Japanese and 
Chinese. In kanji you get effectively two fonts in three weights and two related 
fonts in two weights.</P> 
 
<P>Bitstream is also selling to Printer OEMs and software developers a modified 
versions of <A HREF="http://www.novell.com/">Novell's Envoy</A> with extra 
font handling capabilities. Envoy is a 
competitor to <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe Acrobat</A>, and is 
intended to do the same sort of thing; to 
produce and read documents while retaining all their formatting information, 
including fonts. Did I hear someone in the back row murmuring about Web 
homepages? But of course. Look for the product to turn up within Web browsers.</P> 

<H3>From Russia With Thanks</H3> 
 
<P>The Russian section had a number of packages on offer, nearly all scientific or 
AI-based. I fended off over-enthusiastic sales-tovarishi by saying that I did 
not have a Ph.D. and could not begin to understand their software, excellent 
as it undoubtedly was. My eye was caught by a &quot;design your own jet engine&quot; 
program, complete with gas flows in the combustion chamber, and a wind tunnel 
illustration of what looked remarkably like a MiG-29.</P> 
 
<P>But it was time to get down to business, and so I decided against designing 
very my own jet fighter in favor of more mundane projects such as Russian 
dictionaries and CD-ROMs. Not surprisingly, they had information on the 
products I had read about in the flyer from Lexicon Software, but there was 
nothing there for me. No dictionaries, on CD-ROM, alas, but I did get two 
things that were on my long-term shopping list. I mentioned Cyrillic keyboards 
and Windows Cyrillic drivers, and hit paydirt. A 
brand-new <A HREF="http://www.chicony.com/">Chicony</A> keyboard with 
Roman/Cyrillic lettering and a set of Windows drivers plus TrueType Cyrillic 
Times Roman, Arial and Courier fonts became mine.</P> 
 
<H3>Comedy Time in Ukraine</H3> 
 
<P>I left the Russian stand, amused at the sight of a software package intended to 
control nuclear power stations, and then spotted the Ukrainian booth. What did 
I find but another software package intended to control nuclear power stations? 
As I turned away, shuddering, my eye was caught by a large model of some 
industrial installation or other, with a large hall and a high chimney -- omigawd, 
yes, Chernobyl! I turned away from this view of high tech manqu&eacute; to the low tech; 
CD-ROMs of Ukrainian ecclesiastical chants of the 13th century. A counter-blast 
to the Spanish Benedictines? I was totally bemused by now, and decided 
that someone in the Ukraine must have a truly surreal, nay Pythonesque sense of 
humor, but one look at the stand convinced me that this unbelievable collection 
had been done in all seriousness. I was all set to comment on this, but the 
glacial blonde nymphettes behind the counter were far too absorbed in their 
conversations to take heed of passers-by. It reminded me of the good old Soviet 
days, when the entire USSR was run by jobsworths.</P> 
 
<H3>Too Good To Be True</H3> 
 
<P>Many of the minor vendors were clustered together in groups organized by their 
national chamber of commerce or the like. In one such agglomeration I spotted 
a sign offering <A HREF="http://www.hitachi.com/">Hitachi</A> 4X CD-ROM 
drives for $33. US dollars, if you please. 
I did a double-take at the price, but then discovered that this was a dealer 
price, minimum order 200, FOB California. Too bad, but then I discovered why 
these drives are going cheap: Hitachi have up to 2 million of the things in 
their warehouses. Other vendors don't have this over-supply problem and are 
charging more, but it is clearly putting price pressure on other brands. The 
same Hitachi drive is selling in D&uuml;sseldorf for 99 DM, or about US$65, and I 
was able to get a &quot;Creative&quot; 4X CD-ROM for 100 DM from another vendor just 
before this column was finished. An inspection of the small label on the wee 
beastie as it was installed revealed 
its <A HREF="http://www.mei.co.jp/">Matsushita</A> origins.</P> 
 
<H3><A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/">Walnut Creek</A></H3> 
 
<P>Everyone's favorite purveyor of good 'n' cheap shareware had a booth. 
I bought a few CD-ROMs that were already on my buying list, so I saved 
the postage and got a Dr. Hobbes CD-ROM for OS/2, plus the Japanese text 
processing CD-ROM and clipart collection. The JTP disk includes just about 
every Japanese text editor or formatter available in shareware for DOS and 
Unix. The clipart consists of scanned photos with a heavy emphasis on 
typical tourist fodder such as temples and festivals. Not much use to me, so I'll 
try <A HREF="http://www.realtime.net/~adamrice/mg/index.html">Matsuri Graphics</A> again 
in the USA and see what is now available in their selection of nicely-drawn clipart.</P> 
 
<H3>A New Contour For Your Mouse</H3> 
 
<P>Mice come in a variety of shapes, but the basic premise is the same; you 
hold it between your fingers and move it with your wrist. This gets tiring, 
and ultimately causes pain and stiffness in your hand. This is bad 
enough with graphics-based word processors, but CAD and DTP require almost 
constant mousing, to the point where RSI becomes a problem. An architect 
suffering from RSI designed a mouse that is genuinely innovative.</P> 
 
<P><A HREF="http://www.contourdes.com/index.htm">Contour Design</A> have 
produced a mouse that looks more like a slug. It is much 
bigger and higher than ordinary mice, and also has a thumb rest on one side. 
The mouse comes in three sizes, according to the size 
of your hand, and only in three-button form. What then is the difference?</P> 
 
<P>The manual goes to some length to explain how to use the mouse so as to avoid 
strain. You place your hand on the mouse, with the fingers lying flat on the 
keys, and with the thumb in the thumb rest. You do not need to pinch the 
mouse with your thumb, since it is held in place by your hand resting on the 
entire mouse. Operating the keys is like playing the piano. Your hand 
remains open and relaxed at all times.</P> 
 
<P>The mouse is built to higher standards of quality than the MS Mouse, and it 
will cost a bit more. Retails prices are likely to be around US$60-70. The 
bane of cheap mice is two-fold; rolling balls and tracking units 
that do not respond properly, and key switches that don't always actuate. The 
Contour Mouse is designed for people who use their mouse all day for professional 
work.</P> 
 
<P>I ordered one of these mice from the USA 
via <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com/">Compuserve</A> a few days after 
returning from CeBIT, and I like it greatly after the initial feeling of 
clumsiness. It is less sensitive than the Microsoft Mouse to mousepad quality, 
and it is genuinely untiring to use, although I have to break myself of the 
habit of arching my fingers and squeezing it in a death-grip. The mouse can be 
programmed in many different ways, so I just have to remember the combinations 
and beware of accidentally pressing a collection of buttons. The mouse can be 
programmed under Windows for all applications or for named ones, to avoid 
key-button combination conflicts. One neat feature for graphics; you can 
enlarge the pixels under the cursor by four times. Ideal for what I am doing 
right now, which is cleaning up scanned line art for a technical manual.</P>

<H3>Back at the Ranch...</H3> 
 
<P>Some follow-up to CeBIT. A salesman came round to the office as a result of 
my call to the <A HREF="http://www.polaroid.com/">Polaroid</A> stand. He 
offered to let me have a Polaroid screen 
filter on trial for two weeks, and was keen to sell me the 200 DM model as 
opposed to the 120 DM I had set my heart on. It turns out that the cheaper one 
is &quot;only&quot; four-layer technology and does not have the EMF-filtration feature. 
Nonetheless, I have asked him to come back in mid-May, and I'll try one or 
both or the filters on my system.</P> 
 
<P>It crosses my mind that I might change my monitor one day. I saw an ad for 
the <A HREF="http://www.radius.com/">Pivot</A> monitor in one of 
the computer magazines, and that might be an ideal 
choice. The effective space of a 21&quot; monitor but not as physically big, since 
you can swivel it. A bit like the old monochrome Genius monitors, in fact, but 
able to switch planes electronically and physically. Alas, I have not seen a 
Pivot monitor anywhere -- there may well have been one at CeBIT, for all I 
know, and I don't know how it rates for screen quality, but it should 
be adequate at least.</P> 
 
<H3>Inducement Sways Doubtful Novice (ISDN)</H3> 
 
<P>It is dangerous to make categorical statements, especially in the privacy of 
the Ionic Column. While my CD-ROM was being installed, the helpful Teuton 
commented that an ISDN installation would get a rebate of anything from 300 to 
700 DM if I did the deed before July 1st. I was extremely skeptical, but it 
appears that the whole business might be affordable and trouble-free, especially 
if everything is done for me by the same HT. It looks as if there are cost 
advantages for me, since I have two telephone lines already and don't 
want to mess around with line switchers again. It might also be an alternative 
to getting a faster modem. I await the details.</P> 
 
<P>In the next column I'll have a round-up on memory management, including 
<A HREF="http://www.qualitas.com/">386 to the Max</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.helixsoftware.com/">Netroom</A> 
and <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/">RAM Doubler</A>. Nothing very 
dramatic, unless you don't know already about the Netroom cloaked 
utilities. I'll also have more comments 
about <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Windows 3.1 / 95</A> in the light 
of a brief discussion with Corel at CeBIT, and a few words on 
<A HREF="http://www.corel.ca/">Corel Draw 6.0 and Ventura Publisher 6.0</A>.</P>
