<H1>Hello from the new Co-Publisher</H1>
<P>
</P>

<HR>

<P>Hi, I'm the new Co-Publisher of the Algorithmica Japonica. I'd like to
introduce myself, and tell you about how the AJ is produced.</P>

<H3>Who am I? And how did I get into this?!</H3>

<P>I've been living in Japan for about ten years. I'm an English teacher
(horrors! &lt;G&gt;) and do some editing and writing on the side. I'm from
Canada, and my educational background is in Education and Journalism.</P>

<P>I joined the TPC in 1988, though members of the group may be surprised 
to hear this. I was a &quot;silent&quot; member for a long time. I finally 
got on the BBS regularly a year ago, got to know other members better, and 
began contributing articles to the AJ. The next thing I knew, I found 
myself volunteering for the Publisher position.</P>

<P>The point of  this background info is: If you're one of our many 
&quot;silent members,&quot; we'd love to have more of your input. In 
the last year I quickly learned that the TPC is a great group of people, 
with widely varying backgrounds, and with a great range of computer 
experience, from beginner to guru. Don't be shy - I've been having a 
great time since I took the plunge and got involved.</P>

<H3>How is the AJ produced?</H3>

<P>Take a look at the
<A HREF="ajsyst2.gif">flowchart</A> (14 KB GIF).</P>

<P>Still with me? OK.</P>

<P>To be honest, I feel a bit inadequate when it comes to describing 
the process, as this is my first complete issue as publisher. 
But our esteemed editor, 
<A HREF="mailto:mike.lloret@tokyopc.bbs.net">Mike Lloret</A>, showed 
me the ropes on the last issue, and has  been a great help in building 
my confidence in taking over this position.</P>

<P>Before I go on, I'd like to give Mike a round of applause - he's 
been doing double-duty as both editor and publisher, with
<A HREF="http://www2.gol.com/users/stuart/index.html">Stuart Woodward's</A>
help, for the last year. Thanks guys!</P>

<H3>Other AJ volunteers:</H3>

<P>I'd also like to mention some other key members of the team, and 
what they do. Ann Colville has been producing the back cover 
&quot;Babbitoon&quot; for many years. She does the cartoons by hand, 
and it takes a lot of effort. Stuart Woodward has been doing the 
front covers, experimenting with various graphics programs, and sharing 
his secrets with us.</P>

<P>No newsletter is worth a damn if nobody can read it. While many 
members pick up the AJ at the monthly meetings, Roland Hechtenberg 
recently volunteered for the laborious task of mailing the newsletter 
to those who can't make it to meetings. Roland is taking over from
<A HREF="mailto:101216.1675@compuserve.com">Ken Cotton</A> who did a 
yoemanly job of the stuffing, labelling and stamping for the last 
year.</P>

<P>The AJ also has a small but growing presence on the World Wide Web.
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/home.html">Jim Tittsler</A> hosts 
the site, and is our WWW and HTML guru. Jim has done the bulk of the 
work in setting up and maintaining the site. Stewart Woodward, and 
yours truly, have also contributed to putting some of the AJ into HTML.</P>

<P>We hope to put more of the AJ on the WWW, and from this issue, we 
should be posting more quickly and regularly. It would also be nice to 
get more stories from the 1995 issues on the Web. If you're interested in 
HTML, let us know. Contrary to rumor, HTML is not a programming language, 
and it's easy to learn the basics of marking up text and adding links.</P>

<P>What is time-consuming is tracking down and entering links into the 
WWW versions of articles, to make them more &quot;hypertextual&quot; 
and useful.</P>

<H3>Where do the articles come from?</H3>

<P>From members. Members who write reviews of hardware, software and 
books. Members who write stories about their computing experiences, 
and their visions of technology. Members who find and grab informative, 
useful or funny information and copyright-free articles from BBS 
systems and the Internet, and send them to the editor.</P>

<P>We are always looking for more material, so please contribute. 
Talk to Mike.</P>

<P>It's most convenient for the editor and publisher to work with text 
files that are saved in plain ASCII format. RTF format is the next best. 
This is not only for the DTP, but also for future conversion to HTML. 
All word processors can save into ASCII. If you send an article that 
depends on a lot of special formatting or tables that ASCII can't handle, 
send it in your native word processor, but please try to include brand 
and version number, and a copy in ASCII as well.</P>

<P>The easiest way to send files is to upload them to Mike on the BBS 
as files attached to email messages, or to file area #23 (Newsletter 
Uploads). If you can't access the BBS, you can mail a 3 1/2&quot; floppy, 
or even a paper printout.</P>

<H3>Hardware</H3>

<P>Since we are a computer club, perhaps a few words about the hardware 
and software involved in publishing the AJ are in order. If anybody is 
interested in producing their own newsletter, it doesn't take all that 
much to publish a decent rag (besides time!)</P>

<P>Editing and laying out the AJ is a cooperative effort. Mike and I 
both use <A HREF="http://www.gw2k.com/">Gateway 2000s</A>. He's got a 
Pentium, and I'm still plugging away on a 486. Both of us have 24MB 
of RAM, running under Windows 3.1X, with memory management courtesy 
of  <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/">RAM Doubler</A>, so we can 
keep multiple graphics-heavy  programs running lockup-free 
simultaneously.</P>

<P>If your system isn't quite as powerful as these, don't worry. 
I've published newsletters in the past on a 386 with 4 - 8MB of RAM 
with no trouble. It's just slower.</P>

<P>We've both got &quot;jukebox&quot; multiple CD-ROM changers that 
can hold 6-7 CDs, which are a great help for keeping a lot of graphics 
and font CDs readily available, without a lot of fumbling around and 
manual switching.</P>

<P>Mike's also got the TPC's <A HREF="http://www.hp.com/">HP</A> scanner, 
to be able to scan Ann Colville's cartoon, text, photos, etc., to put in 
the newsletter. And he's got a laser printer to output the final pages to 
take to the printer. We both have 28.8 modems, which we use to 
communicate via the TPC BBS, and exchange files as we work on them.</P>

<P>Love that BBS! It makes life so easy for contributors to the AJ to 
upload articles, and for the editor and co-publishers to work on it 
every month. If you're not on the BBS, I strongly urge you to learn 
how to use it.</P>

<H3>Software</H3>

<P>The basic DTP (Desk Top Publishing) software we are going to 
use from this issue is 
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/SalesInfo/pub2cddk.htm">MS Publisher</A>.
Why Publisher? Mike and I both have it. How's that for a simple reason?
Seriously, it's the best, cheap (under US$100), easy-to-use DTP software 
around. The AJ was published with 
<A HREF="http://www.lotus.com/">Ami Pro</A> in the past, but Publisher 
may have a few extra features. I'd love to try 
<A HREF="http://www.quark.com/">Quark</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">PageMaker</A>, but a) Mike and I 
don't have these &quot;king-of-the-hill&quot; DTP packages, and the 
club can't afford them, and, b) they'd probably be overkill for a 
monochrome, short newsletter like the AJ.</P>

<P>Other important software includes 
<A HREF="http://www.corel.ca/">Corel Draw!</A> for manipulating and 
creating graphics, <A HREF="http://www.visio.com/">Visio</A> for 
making flowcharts (the flowchart linked to this article was created in 
Visio 4.0),<A HREF="http://www.qdeck.com/">HiJaak Pro</A> for 
additional graphics conversion and management, and of course, various 
word processing programs.</P>

<P>Mike, Stuart and I also rely on 
<A HREF="http://www.corel.ca/">Corel Gallery 2</A>; 
<A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/">Walnut Creek</A> &quot;2000 True
Type Fonts &amp; 5,000 Clip Art&quot;; 
<A HREF="http://www.qdeck.com/">Imageline PicturePak</A>, etc. CD-ROMS 
for clip art and fonts.</P>

<H3>The Bottom Line</H3>

<P>The Algorithmica Japonica depends on member input for articles. 
I can play with layout, graphics, etc., but we need your material! 
Mike is a friendly editor, please talk to him about any ideas you have. 
Hope to hear from you soon.</P>
