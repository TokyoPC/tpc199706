<P>Robert Irizarry reviewed his Timex data watch in last month's AJ, and 
in the spirit of childish one-upmanship (we are in good company with the 
Newt and Slick Clint), I thought I'd review my new toy, the Voice 
Organizer. This little black box is the shape of a thin Dove soap bar 
and records voice messages, sets them to a time in the future with your 
voice input and repeats them back to you later.</P>

<P>I am apt to write down a list of things to do, and then leave the list 
at home in the morning rush to the sardine train. When I saw the write-up 
in <A HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/">WIRED</A> magazine for the Voice 
Organizer, I thought this might be a solution. On the plane to the US 
there was in ad in the in-flight magazine, so I ordered one.</P>
 
<P>The Voice Organizer from 
<A HREF="http://www.primenet.com/~vpti/">Voice Powered Technology</A> is 
distributed through 
<A HREF="http://www.sharperimage.com/">The Sharper Image</A> and that
unpronounceable German-sounding catalog sales outfit. It is essentially a
hand-held voice-activated agenda and reminder. It fits nicely in the palm 
of your hand and has four buttons along the top, and eight on the front 
face. There is a small two-line display screen on the front, just above 
the speaker-microphone holes.</P>

<P>Basic functions: Reminders - you record your voice, and play it back 
whenever you want. A tapeless tape recorder. Ho hum. Neat thing you can 
do with this is set the reminder to beep you at a certain time. You enter 
the time and date in with your voice &quot;five fifteen AM two five 
December&quot; to get that reminder to put the presents under the Christmas 
tree. If it screws up on the December and displays November, say 
&quot;NO&quot; and it tries again, matching the closest possible one.</P>

<P>The beep goes off at the specified time, and every five minutes for 
the next half hour, then switches to every half hour (just hit one of 
the buttons to shut it up if you are in a meeting). Then hit the play 
button  to get that pearl of wisdom and foresight you recorded 
earlier.</P>

<P>You can make recurring reminders, too; &quot;Take your vitamins&quot; 
for the same time each day, week or month. You can use the calendar 
function to review all the messages you sent yourself for any particular 
day. There is also a calculator for quick simple (+, -, x, /) stuff for 
those afraid of using a ten-key pad.</P>

<P>My favorite part is the phone directory. Enter in phone, business 
phone and fax for anyone. I select the group FGHI, push the record 
button and say &quot;Robert&quot; and then Irizarry's numbers. Then 
all I need to do is say &quot;Robert&quot; and it fetches his number. 
They should install this option in a cellular phone so you don't have 
to dial the numbers.</P>

<P>There are two versions, one with 512K and the other with 1024K, 
slightly more expensive. It can hold up to 8 minutes of 
messages - hundreds. The battery lasts two days of normal use, then 
starts to warn you that you only got a day left. It comes with a 
nice recharging stand you set it on overnight, which I put next to 
my change/keys dish. They say the batteries should last about two years 
under normal use. There is a backup battery to keep the info in RAM 
while you change batteries.</P>

<P>Now the bad news. Besides getting strange looks for yelling 
&quot;NO&quot; at my fist, there are other drawbacks. You have to train 
the thing at the beginning to recognize the 25 words it uses to input 
data. Entering in the phone numbers took me almost an hour, and there 
were a lot of misunderstandings, so I had to retrain four or five words. 
The worst thing is that you can't use it effectively in a noisy place 
like a train station or airport. It loses a lot if its recognition 
capability, and getting info out of it by pressing the buttons is 
tedious.</P>

<P>The Sharper Image (that distributor for Yuppies) sells the Voice 
organizer for $225 plus shipping. They also charge taxes because they 
have retail outlets in most states (there is an outlet here in Japan, 
too, so  they won't ship directly here).</P>

<P>Think twice about this little toy, which is helpful, but hard to 
learn how to use, even if you are a Totally Obscene Techno-phile 
(TOT). One nice thing is that I can set it to tell me in the morning 
to &quot;TAKE ME&quot; so I don't leave it at home.</P>
