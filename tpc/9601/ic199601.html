<HR>
<H5>Englishman David Parry lived in Tokyo from 1980 to 1994 and was a 
member of TPC from 1986. A frequent contributor to this publication, 
he was Newsletter Publisher from late 1988 to early 1990 and began the 
Ionic  Column in 1992. This column has won a prize and an honorable 
mention in newsletter awards. To the Tokyo BBS community, he now 
lives in virtual cyberspace and teleports textually over the ether. 
On the physical level, he  currently lives and works in D&uuml;sseldorf, 
that part of Germany that most resembles Japan.</H5>

<P>Thanks to the usual time lag between publication and creation, I did 
not think of doing a round-up on 1995 back in November. It is the kind 
of thing that only impinges on my addled consciousness after seeing the 
Christmas decorations go up in the shops and the racks fill with cards 
portraying an obese but friendly old codger generally resident at zero 
latitude and longitude.</P>

<P>But any sort of round-up is only going to be on a personal level. 
I am sitting out the first euphoric wave of 
<A HREF="http://www.windows.microsoft.com/">Windows 95</A>, I have not got
around to trying 
<A HREF="http://www.austin.ibm.com/pspinfo/os2.html">OS/2</A> yet, and 
the somewhat unexpected move to a Pentium did not bring a dramatic
speed increase. In a word; 1995 was mostly more of the same for me. 
I am now on <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe</A>, I have 
dabbled in the Internet, I have hunted down homepages and e-mail 
addresses, Lest Auld Acquaintance Be Forgot. (Maybe the TPC homepage 
will have a little icon at this point for Web browsers and proud 
owners of sound cards?)</P>

<P>A number of projects await me for 1996.</P>

<P>It is time to get a faster modem and maybe to use four-letter words 
such as ISDN. On the other hand, responses to my questions on the TPC 
BBS indicate that a 64 kbs ISDN connection is no faster than a 
28.8 kbs modem due to the lack of data compression.</P>

<P>I access the Internet through CompuServe, which is a valid option 
at my current low rate of usage and with the imminent upgrading of 
CompuServe nodes to 28.8 kbs here in Germany, and a high likelihood 
of ISDN access to CompuServe as well. All the other on-line services 
here have ISDN access now, or announced for 1996. But I also saw a 
posting to the effect that CompuServe is deliberately slowing down 
access internally to avoid overloading the system, or something of 
the sort. This is the kind of thinking that 
made <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</A> great -- and cost them 
the PC market.</P>

<P>So what is the choice in modems? I had been looking hard at the
<A HREF="http://www.usr.com/">Courier v.34</A> internal, but then 
heard that it was about to be discontinued, and ISDN is now a 
consideration as well. There is a bilingual Courier that speaks 
analog and ISDN, but the latter part might not work in Germany. 
Obviously, there is no lack of good models available locally, but 
I still need to find out whether ISDN is worth the not inconsiderable 
extra charge. I may just go back to my original choice of a 
v.34 Courier.</P>

<P>A scanner is on my wish-list for Santa. In Tokyo I had my trusty
<A HREF="http://www.hp.com/">ScanJet</A>, the new models look even 
better and are remarkably cheap compared to what they cost a few 
years ago. I don't need color, or even gray scale at the moment, 
but I will need a document feeder for high-volume OCR work. OCR 
and machine translation are two topics I could take up in greater 
depth at another time; suffice it to say that I have tried them 
both and the results are lackluster, to put it politely, but under 
certain conditions I think  that they could both work well enough 
to be a valuable time saver for me.</P>

<P>Over here I mainly deal with German, but I sometimes get 
translation work in Russian. When I was in London in October, I 
dropped into the bookshop just off Charing Cross Road that 
specializes in books from eastern Europe to look for some newer 
and better dictionaries. Not much luck with my search, although I 
did find a Russian dictionary for the social sciences compiled 
by my former professor! A casual inquiry about Russian software 
elicited the address of Lexicon Software, a London-based outfit 
that markets a number of programs from Russia in OCR, machine 
translation, word processing and  dictionaries on CD-ROM. 
They also gave me an address in the U.K. for Russian keyboards.</P>

<P>A request to <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A> for
information on a Russian-language driver for Windows has evidently 
been filed in the corporate bit bucket, but Lexicon gave me some 
very useful info on Windows drivers and fonts. Not surprisingly, 
a graphics interface and TrueType fonts make the whole thing very 
simple; I only want to be able to handle Russian text, and I do 
not read in the original messages such as &quot;Counter-revolutionary 
revisionist elements liquidated from your hard disk&quot;. However, 
purely capitalist considerations of money mean that I will wait 
until I really need to go Cyrillic, and I'll start in easy stages. 
First a keyboard and a Windows driver, then maybe a Russian 
dictionary on CD-ROM or the OCR, and  finally the translation program.</P>

<P>At the moment I don't have a decent graphics program. I had 
thought of getting <A HREF="http://www.corel.ca/">Corel Draw 6.0</A>, but 
a comparative review in the latest 
<A HREF="http://www.byte.com/">BYTE</A> says it is better for existing 
Corel users and professional artists; I am neither. For business use 
BYTE recommended a similar suite of graphics programs, the
<A HREF="http://www.micrografx.com/">Micrografx ABC Graphics Suite</A>. It 
too has lots of clip art, photos and extra fonts, plus some other useful 
programs. But both of these are only for Windows 95, which I don't have 
yet, so I will also look at what is available under OS/2. A posting by 
Joel Roth recommended a couple of hot programs.</P>

<P>Another project will be OS/2. I hope that there will be at least one 
killer ap that justifies the cost of the operating system alone, and maybe 
it will be a graphics program (or suite). I would quickly get the OS/2 
version of my communications program, 
<A HREF="http://www.hilgraeve.com/">HyperAccess</A>, so that I can do 
something else while on-line. In BYTE Jerry Pournelle threw down the 
gauntlet to OS/2 by saying &quot;Show me something that it can do that 
Windows 95 cannot&quot;. No answer, but one question: reliably?</P>  

<P>I can see that I will have up to three systems running within a few 
months; OS/2, good ol' Windows 3.1 running under OS/2, and Windows 95. 
Where possible, I will keep the old 16-bit applications running to avoid 
a cash haemorrhage on upgrades, but sooner or later upgrades of existing 
programs, not to mention any new Windows programs that I buy now, may 
require Windows 95. The scanner software is just one such example.</P>

<P>At this point I should add that readers of this column can either 
contact me on the TPC BBS or else through 
<A HREF="mailto:100575.2573@compuserve.com">CompuServe, ID 100575,2573</A>. 
I don't have an Internet address yet, that is one of the things on 
the &quot;to do&quot; list for 1996.</P>
