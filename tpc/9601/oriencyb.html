<H3>ON THE RUNWAY</H3>

<P>The world of electronic media is a novel way of viewing the environment 
we live in.  Represented by digital symbols, displayed through specialized
communication machinery, it is yet a collection of descriptions and 
pictures of the &quot;real&quot; world around us.</P>

<P>Come to think of it: reality is what we can agree on, and new realities 
are created daily, by artists, scientists, politicians and numerous other 
people with varying levels of creativity.  The author of every article 
(this one, too) creates new things people may choose to agree with. 
May you, dear reader, enjoy creating a duplicate of the realities of a 
new world outlined here.  I can only provide a brief glimpse, the great 
discovery is up you. This glimpse peeks in various directions, much the 
same as the typical surfer does on the Internet hypertext library called 
the World-Wide-Web.</P>

<H3>ADD POWER, TAKE-OFF</H3>

<P>Computers are only thinking aids, servo-mechanisms for the mind. 
As I write this text on a hand-held PC, I suddenly realize I do not 
use the first of all computers, paper and a writing instrument. 
Like the paper, this computer has a memory the contents of which I can 
control. Like the paper, I can show my text to others. Like the paper, 
I can make copies and send them through space and time, to be received 
and understood by a distant fellow with whom I have an agreed-upon 
vocabulary.</P>

<P>I like to call my machine a com-puter with &quot;com&quot; as in 
common or communication - what am I writing for, if not to communicate? 
Sharing of viewpoints, propagating knowledge through space to others, 
that is what writing, making movies or any other communication is 
all about, is it not?</P>

<H3>NAVIGATION</H3>

<P>Now, for the concept of cyberspace, back to the &quot;real world&quot;, 
with a &quot;real life&quot; example. Have you noticed how perception of 
your whereabouts changes with the speed you travel? Compare the 
impressions you pick up while walking through the neighborhood versus 
using a bicycle, traveling by car, train or airplane.</P>

<P>Assuming the time on the trip is comparable, we can set up a frame of
reference:</P>
<TABLE><TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><TD COLSTART="1">	</TD><TD COLSTART="2"><B>Walk</B></TD>
<TD COLSTART="3"><B>Ride</B></TD><TD COLSTART="4"><B>Fly</B></TD></TR><TR

<TD COLSTART="2">All senses<BR>Much detail
</TD><TD COLSTART="3">Visual<BR>Accoustical<BR>Selected detail</TD><TD
COLSTART="4">Map<BR>Instrument<BR>Representations</TD></TR><TR
ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><TD COLSTART="1"><B>Experience</B></TD><TD
COLSTART="2">Part of it</TD><TD COLSTART="3">Passing by</TD><TD COLSTART="4">Detached</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><TD COLSTART="1"><B>Familiarity</B></TD><TD
COLSTART="2">With area</TD><TD COLSTART="3">With the way</TD><TD COLSTART="4">With
end points</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>We can now transfer this analogy to cyberspace, because that space is 
just a representation of what we call our &quot;real world&quot;. 
(Here, I refrain from going into speculation or philosophy what our 
&quot;real world&quot; may be the cyber-representation of. ;-)</P>

<H3>AEROBATICS</H3>

<P>In cyberspace, there are also different speeds of travel. These do 
not depend on our modem speed, but rather on the rate with which we 
acquire new data and knowledge. By the way, data and knowledge are not 
the same, they relate to each other like information relates to 
certainty.</P>

<P>In the material world, the speed of travel and much of the fun 
associated with it depend on the vehicle we use and on our skill to 
control this vehicle and to keep it on the desired course. The faster 
vehicles require great skill for starting and landing, but amazingly 
little for most of the time on the way. Ask a pilot.</P>

<P>The faster cyberspace vehicles are similar, they require skill to set 
up, the older vehicles more, the newer vehicles less, present software 
has become rather easy to set up (but is harder to get rid of). Once you 
get a good cyberspace vehicle like a World-Wide-Web browser going, 
it is a fast ride to locate and get information you are looking for. 
Operator error or even a crash is not fatal at all. In worst case, 
simply dial again and start over.</P>

<P>Assuming the time on the trip is comparable, you get another frame of
reference:</P>

<TABLE><TR><TD COLSTART="1"><B>In world space</B></TD><TD COLSTART="2"><B>On
network</B></TD><TD COLSTART="3"><B>Dimension in Cyberspace</B></TD></TR><TR
ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><TD COLSTART="1">Time</TD><TD
COLSTART="2" VALIGN="TOP">Same time</TD><TD COLSTART="3" VALIGN="TOP">The time
it takes,<BR>data may have time shift</TD></TR><TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><TD
COLSTART="1">Distance</TD><TD COLSTART="2">Distance</TD><TD COLSTART="3">Remoteness

COLSTART="2">--</TD><TD COLSTART="3">Divergence of new data<BR>to current
knowledge</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>I admit, I had to warp dimensions to make the analogy fit, but it is 
fun to behold the implications. The tortured term &quot;information 
super-highway&quot; is one-dimensional, it describes only the 
communication line and reeks of government subsidy and control. 
Cyberspace, on the other hand, implies freedom of information and travel, 
much like the concept of space,  which is three-dimensional (free 
and dimensional :).</P>

<H3>HOW FAR IS IT FROM HERE?</H3>

<P>Here a frame of reference for capacities and features.</P>

<TABLE><TR><TD COLSTART="1"><B>World Space</B></TD><TD COLSTART="2"><B>Travel

<TD COLSTART="4">All libraries</TD><TD COLSTART="5">Millions of computers</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>As I evolve it, I am looking at this puzzle and draw a few conclusions. 
Viewing paper storage versus cyberspace, I notice I can give no numbers for 
the paper. I feel it is a factor of 1000 from one level to the next. 
This would give us billions of books on the planet, which is about 
right.</P>

<H3>CONTACT DESTINATION: THE WEATHER FORECAST, PLEASE</H3>

<P>Remember the wisecrack when asked whether he wanted a book for his 
birthday present: &quot;I don't need a book, I already have one.&quot; 
If cyberspace information is bound to be as popular as books we will 
end up with billions of computers to access it and have to invent a 
new joke.</P>

<P>One major difference between books and cyberspace media is the 
resulting information flow, bidirectional. With books (or newspaper 
and other broadcast media) the information flows from author to reader, 
with usually very little returning communication. In cyberspace, the 
return flow can be very easily achieved and may swell to enormous 
volume for the author who gets people active and elicits a large number 
of responses. Poor guy, if he just gets hit with an e-mail writing 
campaign.</P>

<H3>TOUCHDOWN</H3>

<P>Expanding cyberspace entails another major shift - to paperless 
information flows. Emerging standards promise to bridge the gaps 
between today's competing software data formats. Electronic data 
interchange will swiftly sweep much paper out of offices. This may 
save large numbers of trees, but we will pay forthis by the energy it 
takes to build and to run the computers.</P>

<H3>DISEMBARK</H3>

<P>Save energy, switch off your monitor for the lunchbreak. Thank you.</P>
