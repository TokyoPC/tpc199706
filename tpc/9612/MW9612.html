<P>First off, even though it's a little early, I'd like to wish all of you a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  I hope that 1997 is filled with happiness and excitement for all of you, and that it will be the best year yet for the TPC.</P> 
 
<P>One of my Christmas presents came early this year: The Beast has his voice back. Having given up on trying to solve my soundcard problems by myself, I asked <I>Algorithmica Japonica</I> contributor and advertiser Kurt Keller (of Pinboard and HTML article fame...check out his article in this month's issue) to make a house call and see if he could get it running.   Within a couple of hours he had the soundcard problem solved and a couple of other little problems fixed, too, and for a very reasonable fee.</P> 
 
<P>It seems that the <A HREF="http://www.creaf.com/zonemenu.html">Creative Labs</A> AWE32's CD-ROM connector is an IDE one, and although it's the same shape as my proprietary <A HREF="http://www.mitsumi.com/">Mitsumi</A> CD-ROM drive's connector, the pin assignments are different.  The SB16 I'd had in there before was a multi-CD-ROM model, and had a connector specifically for the Mitsumi drive. The rhythmic click/thump it produced instead of sound is apparently either a hardware or jumper problem, but it doesn't matter to me now that  the AWE32  is running.</P>   
 
<P>Of course, since the connector was wrong for my drive, I could get sound but couldn't use the CD-ROM.  Kurt solved this problem by plugging the SB16 into another slot, disabling its sound functions, and using it only as a CD-ROM controller.  Works great!</P> 
 
<P>Although this is pretty much a temporary solution, it should work quite well until I get around to replacing the current CD-ROM drive.  It's only a single disk double-speed drive, and it's about time I replaced it with something faster, and preferably a drive with multiple disks.  I'll be going to Akihabara come bonus time and checking out what's available.</P>   
 
<P>I may just go ahead and replace the motherboard while I'm at it.  Currently, the 
motherboard, CD-ROM drive, and power supply are all that remains of the Beast's original innards.  The single 540MB HDD that I naively thought at the time would last me for years has been replaced with a 2GB drive, and has two more 2GB HDDs to keep it company. The original <A HREF="http://www.gw2k.com/">Gateway2000</A> soundcard and graphics board have been replaced with the AWE32 and 
a <A HREF="http://www.matrox.com/">Matrox</A> Millenium  board, respectively. The BIOS has been upgraded to accommodate Plug-and-Play and large drives, I've added a tape drive and then upgraded it, and the original 16MB of RAM is now 80MB.</P> 
 
<P>When I bought the machine it was the top of the line, but the 66mhz Pentium has just about become an antique, so I guess I'll start looking around for a really fast Pentium or Pentium Pro after the first of the year. Considering how much trouble I've had getting all the add-ins and upgrades so far to work, replacing the motherboard should provide material for at least a couple of columns. Stay tuned.</P>
