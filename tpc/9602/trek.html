<P><EM>Picard</EM> "Mr. LaForge, have you had any success with your attempts 
at finding a weakness in the Borg? And Mr. Data, have you been able 
to access their command pathways?"
 
<P><EM>Geordi</EM> "Yes, Captain. In fact, we found the answer by searching
through our archives on late Twentieth-century computing technology."
 
<P><EM>Geordi presses a key, and a logo appears on the computer screen.</EM>
 
<P><Riker looks puzzled.> "What the hell 
is '<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A>'?" 
 
<P><EM>Data turns to answer.</EM> "Allow me to explain. We will send this 
program, for some reason called 'Windows', through the Borg command 
pathways. Once inside their root command unit, it will begin 
consuming system resources at an unstoppable rate."
 
<P><EM>Picard</EM> "But the Borg have the ability to adapt. Won't they alter 
their processing systems to increase their storage capacity?"
 
<P><EM>Data</EM> "Yes, Captain. But when 'Windows' detects this, it creates 
a new version of itself known as an 'upgrade'. The use of resources 
increases exponentially with each iteration. The Borg will not be 
able to adapt quickly enough. Eventually all of their processing 
ability will be taken over and none will be available for their 
normal operational functions."
 
<P><EM>Picard</EM> "Excellent work. This is even better than that 
'unsolvable geometric shape' idea."
 
<P><EM>***15 Minutes Later***</EM>
 
<P><EM>Data</EM> "Captain, We have successfully installed the 'Windows' 
in the command unit and as expected it immediately consumed 85% 
of all resources. We however have not received any confirmation of 
the expected 'upgrade'."
 
<P><EM>Geordi</EM> "Our scanners have picked up an increase in Borg storage 
and CPU capacity to compensate, but we still have no indication of 
an 'upgrade' to compensate for their increase."
 
<P><EM>Picard</EM> "Data, scan the history banks again and determine if there 
is something we have missed."
 
<P><EM>Data</EM> "Sir, I believe their is a reason for the failure in the 
'upgrade'.  Appearently the Borg have circumvented that part of the 
plan by not sending in their registration cards."
 
<P><EM>Riker</EM> "Captain we have no choice. Requesting permission to begin 
emergency escape sequence 3F,...."
 
<P><EM>Geordi, excited</EM> "Wait, Captain I just detected their CPU capacity 
has suddenly dropped to 0%!"
 
<P><EM>Picard</EM> "Data, what do your scanners show?"
 
<P><EM>Data</EM> "Apparently the Borg have found the internal 'Windows' 
module named 'Solitaire' and it has used up all the CPU capacity."

<P><EM>Picard</EM> "Lets wait and see how long this 'Solitaire' can reduce 
their functionality."
 
<P><EM>***Two Hours Pass***</EM>
 
<P><EM>Riker</EM> "Geordi whats the status on the Borg?"
 
<P><EM>Geordi</EM> "As expected the Borg are attempting to re-engineer to 
compensate for increased CPU and storage demands, but each time they 
successfully increase resources I have setup our closest deep space 
monitor beacon to transmit more 'Windows' modules from something 
called the 'Microsoft fun-pack'."
 
<P><EM>Picard</EM> "How much time will that buy us?"
 
<P><EM>Data</EM> "Current Borg solution rates allow me to predicate an interest 
time span of 6 more hours."
 
<P><EM>Geordi</EM> "Captain, another vessel has entered our sector."
 
<P><EM>Picard</EM> "Identify."
 
<P><EM>Data</EM> "It appears to have markings very similar to the 
'Microsoft' logo."
 
<P><EM>Over the speakers</EM>

<B>"This is Admiral Bill Gates of The MICROSOFT flagship MONOPOLY. We 
have positive confirmation of unregistered software in this sector. 
Surrender all assets and we can avoid any trouble. You have 10 seconds."</B>
 
<P><EM>Data</EM> "The alien ship has just opened its forward hatches and 
released thousands of humanoid shaped objects."
 
<P><EM>Picard</EM> "Magnify forward viewer on the alien craft."
 
<P><EM>Riker</EM> "Good God, captain!  Those are humans floating straight 
toward the Borg ship with no life support suits! How can they survive 
the tortures of deep space?!"
 
<P><EM>Data</EM> "I don't believe that those are humans sir, if you will 
look closer I believe you will see that they are carrying something 
recognized by twenty-first century Man as doe skin leather briefcases, 
and wearing Armani suits."
 
<P><EM>Riker and Picard together horrified</EM> "Lawyers !!"
 
<P><EM>Geordi</EM> "It can't be. All the Lawyers were rounded up and sent 
hurtling into the sun in 2017 during the Great Awakening."
 
<P><EM>Data</EM> "True, but appearently some must have survived."
 
<P><EM>Riker</EM> "They have surrounded the Borg ship and are covering it with 
all types of papers."
 
<P><EM>Data</EM> "I believe that is known in ancient venacular as 'red tape' 
- it often proves fatal."
 
<P><EM>Riker</EM> "They're tearing the Borg to pieces!"
 
<P><EM>Picard</EM> "Turn off the monitors. I can't stand to watch, not even 
the Borg deserve that."
