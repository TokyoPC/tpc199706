<H1>Akihabara Tour - Sunday, January 21, 1996</H1>
<P>
</P>
<H2>by Sigi Rindler</H2>
<HR>
 
<P>This time it was just a small group of 8, but that's better for me 
since this crowd is better to handle than a pile of wild ants... Remember 
the first Aki tour last year where half of the crowd got lost within 15 
minutes after lunch (because I refused to carry a big flag, and Steve 
Bellamy did his very best to drive all women crazy)!<g>
 
<P>There was Hubert, the French NHK talento, Eric, another Frenchman, 
Todd Boyle (yes, that Todd!), Joseph Nortey rushing over from faraway 
Ghana, "high-tech VIP" Ken Cotton with the dictaphone in his left hand 
and his Handy in the other, while holding his smelling clover cigarette 
between his lips. Initially I thought that my favorite curry shop was on 
fire.... Then there was Masako, the mascot of this colorful group, 
dressed up for hurdling competitions with our French fellows.  
 
<P>Well, I was there too, since I was supposed lead the group. I even 
overheard a remark when someone called me "Mein Führer".... Ahem... 
but that's the German word for leader, which I was supposed to be for 
a couple of hours. 
 
<P>OK, let's go! 
 
<P>You know the rule by now, don’t you? Go straight down to STEP first! 
Pass the Mansei Bridge, the public toilet on the left, the huge Mansei 
restaurant building. Right after, there was a guy sleeping on a real 
futon and covered by a couple of blankets just beside the sidewalk. A 
couple of steps further you'll see the STEP Mac shop. I already 
explained about how to go to the PC outlet at the other side of the road.
 
<P>The very cheap <A HREF="http://www-es.compaq.com/">Compaq</A> goodies 
had gone, but the shop is well stocked with 
<A HREF="http://www.sony.co.jp/">Sony</A> monitors and, for the first 
time, with <A HREF="http://www.gw2k.com/">Gateway</A> computers. The 
<A HREF="http://www.hp.com/">HP ScanJet</A> was &#165;88,800 
(of course, the Japanese version without the latest Omnipage Pro OCR 
that US-made HP scanners feature). Ken Cotton noted that this one was 
cheap since he checked the prices before. 
 
<P>Heading back over Mansei Bridge (no futons on the sidewalk at this 
side). It's 11:30 and too early to visit LASER 5, the CD-ROM shop at 
the dead end of Akihabara that does not open before 12:00. Instead 
we ventured down to the side-street just before the large Laox Computer 
store and turned left. 
 
<P>There is TRISAL in one of the upper floors, but pamphlets can be 
obtained by everyone at street level. The steep staircases are very 
narrow and limit the clientele to slim guys like.... Well, sumotori 
types snub these shops! 
 
<P>There are also many second hand parts shops in this street. Take your 
time and walk up and down narrow staircases. You might find great deals. 
A bit further up the road on the right is the Sofmap Used Part Shop 
(not the one for <A HREF="http://www.nec.com/">NEC</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.epson.com/index.html">EPSON</A> stuff located 
before this one). There you find cheap 
<A HREF="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</A>-Ethernet cards, etc. It was 
too crowded, so I didn't really check. One thing that caught my 
attention were several "Fujitsu Towns" machines with CD-ROM drives 
for &#165;10,000 to &#165;15,000....

<P>They looked almost new, and I know that they were sold for &#165;300,000 
to &#165;400,000 some years ago. Nowadays you don't necessarily buy a game 
for your computer, because a computer for your game might be the better 
deal!<g> 
 
<P>Really, I saw <A HREF="http://www.toshiba.com/">Toshiba</A> 
laptops (plasma screen) for as little as &#165;2,000! Slow by nowadays 
standards but for the price of eight or nine packs of cigarettes! They 
cost between &#165;300,000 and &#165;500,000 years ago and were 
state-of-the-art gadgets.
 
<P>BTW, T-Zone has an outlet for CPUs, chips, monitors, modems, etc., 
at the end (left side) on this street. Not exactly the cheapest store, 
but it's a pretty safe place compared to other make-shift stores that come 
and go. 
 
<P>From there we went to LASER 5. It's the worst location I could imagine 
for any *denki* shop in this city, but they must be making the money to 
pay the rent. There is a lot of stuff for many, but I never got the kick 
out of it.
 
<P>Back to the heart of Akihabara via some different streets under the 
Sobu railway overpass. Again we saw plenty of newly arrived monitors up 
to 21" for &#165;3,000 each. I guess, the guys will show you whether they 
work before buying.
 
<P>Suddenly I realized that 3 guys in the group got lost, our Ken Cotton 
and Todd Boyle among them. But thanks to Ken's clover cigarettes, I could 
easily sniff them out in no time...
 
<P>Almost 13:00... time for lunch at the announced restaurant at 
Akihabara's DEPARTMENT STORE, a term that was probably justified shortly 
after WWII! On the way we passed by the "good man" discount store. The 
Chinese seaweed soap (promising weight loss) being sold for &#165;1,980 a bar 
last summer was now &#165;100! A couple of us guys stocked up on soap bars 
since they make great and expensive-looking presents for our loved ones 
at home!
 
<P>We also got these &#165;291 classical CDs with DDD imprinted. I can't say 
about my fellows (Ken Cotton might or might not complain later), but 
DON'T buy the "Vienna Waltz, Johann Strauss 1&amp;2"! This recording is not
the expected DDD sound quality but SMS (speaker-microphone-speaker 
sound transfer). Well, that's (Akihabara) life: you can't have it all.
 
<P>13:00! Time for lunch. Todd ordered spaghetti, didn't like it, and 
told Masako about this fact 3 seconds after her order of the same lunch 
set. Otherwise we had an informal lunch and a great time with plenty of 
laughter and many eyes staring at us from neighboring tables.
 
<P>13:40... we left the restaurant and noticed the waiter's happy face 
for the first time. Everybody was having ice cream downstairs until one 
reported Masako missing. When I was about to appoint Todd to check the 
ladies' room for her, she suddenly appeared.
 
<P>Went without authorization to the "100 Yen Shop" on the first floor. 
After a stern warning we went for a short stint to Sofmap's Chicago store 
to check for cheap English computer magazines. No luck, all had already 
gone. Todd suggested to visit Shibuya's "Mega Tower" store where they are 
plentiful and cheap.
 
<P>After that we spent 10 minutes at the Laox Computer store (foreign book 
section). They have almost anything you'd need, but their prices are 
really royal! Magazines and certain books can be had for half price 
elsewhere... if they are available.
 
<P>From Laox we crossed the wide street, went toward Mitsubishi Bank, but 
turned left just before the bank. After 1 minute you'll see ATZTEC. They 
sell a variety of computers, computer cases, cards, modems, etc. It's not 
a "must see" shop, but they do have discounted goodies at times.
 
<P>From the shop window we saw some gaijin dancing in a frenzy! A closer 
look at the performer revealed that it was one of our guys. Ken Cotton 
had spotted the cheapest <A HREF="http://www.hp.com/">HP ScanJet 4c</A> 
in town!!! (&#165;84,000) I forgot the name of the shop, but it's the shop 
which is located at exactly the opposite side of ATZTEC, filled with boxes 
up to the ceiling.
 
<P>Next: DOS/V Paradise. The first thing that catches your attention is 
that the very familiar <A HREF="http://www.gw2k.com/">Gateway</A> boxes 
outside the shop had been replaced by 
<A HREF="http://www.mei.micron.com/">Micron</A> boxes. Micron is a bit 
expensive, though. There isn't much difference to 
<A HREF="http://www.dell.com/">Dell</A> or 
<A HREF="http://www-es.compaq.com/">Compaq</A> anymore, and Compaq will 
provide a 3 year warranty! No other computer manufacturer will do that 
here. This makes the Compaq Prolinea systems choice #1 over 
<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</A> Aptivas, which cost about 
the same. We didn't stay long since their prices are no good anymore 
compared to a year ago.
 
<P>When we passed "Lahoru", the Indian curry shop, Hubert, our French 
buddy, must have caught the Lahoru virus! From this time he kept on 
speaking ethnic Indian-English. I think that everybody had more fun one 
this second leg of the tour than during the entire month. Todd displayed 
the first signs of impatience.
 
<P>Around the corner was ATTLA (former Spunky). Less attractive than 
before, if I may say so. Out of the shop and down to the Chuo Dori, which 
was now closed to the traffic. That's one of Akihabara's highlights!
 
<P>Ken Cotton started to pester us with a new gadget he had acquired 
somewhere before for &#165;1,000; a tiny knife with a pin to clean his dirty 
fingernails. I told him that could get this one thrown in for free if I 
bought that fake Swiss army knife for &#165;700 at a certain discount 
store...<eg>
 
<P>Then we suffered our first victims of the tour. Ken and Todd had to 
leave. Next on the plan was A-Master (the previous corner-landmark, 
the chanting Aumies had gone). They have decent prices on their Pentium 
machines, and all kinds of other useful stuff. Go there and see yourself. 
Their reputation is still good. I'll buy my new 1.6GB hard disk 
<A HREF="http://www.wdc.com/">(Western Digital)</A> there since no one 
else sells it for &#165;33,000! Warranty is one year as usual. Well, STEP 
sells it even for &#165;200 less, but A-Master doesn't give you a hassle 
if you have to bring it back....
 
<P>Next stop was DOS/V Paradise (5F) in the block of the old T-ZONE 
building. They still sell Gateway programmable keyboards for &#165;3,000, 
while their main shop has them for &#165;5,800!!! If you buy one, make sure 
about your keyboard jack at the back of your computer. This keyboard has 
a laptop plug. The adaptor costs another &#165;500.
 
<P>Back into the elevator and passing the "dirty CD-ROM shop" on the 
6th floor since Masako was still with us.... Finally we arrived at our 
ast destination, the DOS/V Paradise CD-ROM shop (7F). They have 
(sometimes) a good selection and better prices than elsewhere. Goodies 
from software bundles and such. Sometimes they have MS Office 
(full version) for about &#165;5,000!
 
<P>Some of our guys must have sneaked out and went to the 6th floor, 
anyway, suddenly they were all back again with the distinct shopping 
bags from that shop! I bought "After Dark", the new screen saver for 
<A HREF="http://www.windows.microsoft.com/">WIN95</A>. My complaints 
about WIN95 software and other related stuff will be uploaded to the 
BBS in another message during the following days....
 
<P>One important hint: Don't throw your receipts away before you have 
installed the software and you have made sure that everything really 
works!
 
<P>Well, this wraps up our first Akihabara tour this year. Hope to have 
another one in the future. And thanks to everybody who joined in!
