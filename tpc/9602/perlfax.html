<H1>A Perl Dabbler Tries His Hand at a Fax-to-Internet Gateway</H1>
<P>
</P>

<HR>
 
<P>Yes it's true. Yours truly, a would-be programmer, has actually set 
up a multitasking fax-to-internet gateway.
 
<P>I wanted to help a translator friend get work by fax after he moved 
back to Australia. Conceptually, it seemed rather simple to use fax 
software and a faxmodem to receive faxes, and then to send them by e-mail 
or ftp to his internet account.
 
<P>I was beguiled and started to work with the tools at hand: 
<A HREF="http://www.austin.ibm.com/pspinfo/os2.html">OS/2</A>, 
<A HREF="http://mox.perl.com/">perl</A>, 
a spare modem with fax software, and an internet account.
 
<P>The fax receive software (I used Quick Link II and later BGFAX) 
generates a log file that lists the filename, date and time received, 
number of pages, whether the transmission ended normally and, 
significantly, the ID string received from the sender.
 
<P>To save on phone lines (which cost about ¥70 - ¥80,000 each to buy and 
install) my first idea was to receive faxes for several translators on a 
single line. I'd use the ID string to identify the sender, and use that 
to determine where to send the fax. Astute readers will quickly realize 
that if this system routes faxes from Agency ABC to Translator Smith, it 
can't route faxes from Agency ABC to Translator Jones as well.
 
<P>I'd like to offer people their own phone number as well, which would 
allow them to receive faxes from anyone without the above restrictions. 
To keep down costs, I am 
using <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/">NTT's</A> Dial-In service and a special 
box (supplied by Hokuto Telecom Systems) to receive calls for three 
numbers over a single line in sort of a Japanese counterpart to the 
distinctive ringing service available in the States. In future I might 
incorporate some PBX or voice-mail software for OS/2 to allow a single 
sender to send faxes to multiple destinations.
 
<P>Setting up OS/2 to receive faxes automatically using Quick Link II for 
DOS turned out to be rather easy. A virtual DOS machine runs in the 
background like any other process. There is apparently a whole esoterica 
to starting processes. The parent process can wait for the child process 
to terminate, the child can run independently of the parent, there can 
even be pipes to pass IO streams between parents, children and siblings. 
And in the cruel world of computing, killing processes is routine.

<P>To set up the system, I had to coordinate three different programs: 
<UL><LI>A FAX RECEIVE program that starts at boot and is always ready 
to receive.
<LI>An ENQUEUE program that reads the fax receive logs and enqueues fax files and their routing data in a 
<LI>couple of spool directories. 
<LI>A TRANSFER program that sends out the files and clears the spool.</UL> 
 
<P>With OS/2, I am fortunate that the OS provides file locking, which 
ensures that file operations are atomic. ENQUEUE can't touch a fax in the 
process of being received till FAX RECEIVE closes it. TRANSFER can't 
access files in the spool directories until they have arrived completely. 
And with that, yours truly doesn't need to learn about semaphores or other 
multitasking security mechanisms!
 
<P>Another exciting puzzle piece was finding that there are several 
shareware 'cron' programs for OS/2. Like the Unix 'cron' program, these 
scheduling utilities watch the clock, and start certain processes at 
certain times. So I can set the system to check every 15 minutes if any 
faxes have come, to enqueue them, and to send them out.
 
<P>I found other things that contribute to a more reliable system. I found 
I can set OS/2 to reboot automatically on a system hang, I can suppress 
pop-up error messages that require the user to click on an "OKAY" button 
(the messages are logged in a file), and I have a 'reboot' command, should 
I want to reboot the machine periodically. This information is available, 
but takes some perseverance to find, especially if you're not aware it 
even exists!
 
<P>Early on I decided I would send files to their destinations by 
UUencoded email or FTP over a PPP link. FTP has the advantage that 
files arrive in one piece in the recipient's home directory. Of course you 
need the person's password for this. (Is it any more dangerous than giving 
out your credit card number to a mail-order firm?)

<P>Using PPP has advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, I don't 
have to think much about the internet provider, since once PPP is 
connected, my humble PC becomes a site on the internet. I just run local 
clients for mail and FTP from an OS/2 command line. This is much easier 
than trying to write telecom scripts to execute commands on the internet 
provider.
 
<P>Or so I thought. As it turns out, all the network client programs I've 
found know nothing of PPP, and assume that they are on stable, robust 
TCP/IP networks. If the PPP phone connection is broken, these clients never 
timeout, and never terminate. Zmodem, in contrast, is prepared to deal with 
the vagaries of modem communications: it knows how to time out. My POPMAIL 
and FTP clients don't. If these clients never terminate, processing stops.
 
<P>I found a multitasking-sort-of-solution: start the POPMAIL and FTP 
clients as detached processes, calculate how long their transfers should 
take under poor conditions, and kill them if they take too long or if 
PPP dies and they're still alive. I also set up a PPP monitor to kill PPP 
if the connection runs too long.
 
<P>The software for all this was written as a mixture of perl programs, 
batch files, and even batch files containing perl programs. OS/2 has its 
own batch language, called REXX, which has its roots in the mainframe 
world. IBM developed it to have a uniform scripting language over all its 
various operating systems. But yours truly didn't want to learn it, and 
has stuck to simple DOS-style batch commands, with perl taking up the 
slack. I found there are REXX libraries for FTP, but that was after 
I'd navigated the more roundabout solution of using perl to write macros 
for ncFTP, a Unix FTP client that has been ported to OS/2.
 
<P>The system seems to work. Faxes come in and get sent out along with 
an e-mail message that tells the user the number of pages and the sender. 
It gets better the more that people pound on it. I'm particularly indebted 
to Douglas Burbury for sending faxes ranging in length from 10 to 80 
pages, which brought up some unusual failure modes. For the truly 
paranoid, I now send a message everyday to indicate that the service 
is operational.
 
<P>The biggest problem seems to be explaining the service to people. 
Instead of picking incoming faxes off the floor where they've fallen out 
of his fax machine, the user will have to download files from his internet 
account and use a shareware utility to view them or print them out on a 
laser printer. This will obviously require the sort of skills that a 
person needs to set the clock on a video machine, restricting the service 
to a relatively elite clientele.
 
<P>Most of the project was completed over about two weeks when I was 
between translation jobs. I encountered numerous hurdles, and dealing 
with each one took hours to days, leaving me envious of those in-house 
programmers fortunate enough to have a talented and compassionate mentor. 
The author recommends against learning programming in the school of hard 
knocks!
 
<P>The actual code is not more than about 25k of ASCII text in several 
perl library files and a couple more scripts that draw on them. I'm sure 
a real programmer could have turned 
something out in an afternoon.
 
<P>But I have learned a lot in the process, and lurking in the 
<A HREF="news:comp.lang.perl.misc">comp.lang.perl.misc</A>
 newsgroup has been a great help. So perhaps, all 
things considered, programming by the seat-of-your-pants method may not be 
such a bad idea.
