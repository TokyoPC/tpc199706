<H1>Akihabara Shops and Goodies</H1>

<P>This month's review of Akihabara shops and goodies started when the 
new year was just 6 days old. Since I had nothing else to do I thought 
it was a good time to get informed after 3 months or so....
 
<P>Well, things have changed quite a bit.
 
<P>The goods in the new Laox Duty Free Shop (30m opposite the Akihabara 
Department Store) have greatly increased. Good, huge, and sturdy looking 
suitcases can be had for &#165;9,000 to &#165;15,000. I remember the 
days when a small one cost you from &#165;20,000 up.
 
<P>They have a collection of very attractive ladies’ watches — actually 
"7 in one" — the outer ring around the glass can be unscrewed and 
exchanged with another one. My wife thinks that I have put my hand deep 
in my pocket (&#165;2,900... Haaa!). This way I didn't have to explain why 
I had to ask her for a "refill" of my wallet the day after. A good and 
inexpensive present at the right moment can yield a lot...<g> See the 
watches yourself, they are unique.
 
<P>As usual, the first shop to check out is STEP beyond Mansei Bridge. 
Had a look at the STEP Software Jungle (beside the STEP Mac shop). That's 
the place that sold the original 
<A HREF="http://www.windows.microsoft.com/">WIN95</A> (full version) 
for &#165;1,000 (yes, your eyes are OK). This wonder occurred one week 
before the Japanese version was put on the shelves. The bargains are over, 
and the whole store is stocked with Japanese software. The attraction has 
gone for the time being....
 
<P>Next, out of here, cross the street, and straight into STEP's PC outlet. 
It was kind of busy just 10 minutes after the shop opened at 11:00 am. 
Soon I found out why (I think). They were selling old but brand-new 
<A HREF="http://www-es.compaq.com/">Compaq</A> Prolinea computers w/o 
monitor.   

<P>Prolinea 4/33S: 486/33MHz, 4MB RAM, 200MB HD, 2X CD-ROM, loaded with 
Japanese DOS and WIN for &#165;39,800.
 
<P>There were another two machines that had the same specs. in the opposite 
corner and had big price tags on them that said "&#165;25,000"!!! I asked one 
of the salesmen, but they know virtually NOTHING. Don't buy anything if 
you can't figure it out yourself.
 
<P>Hint:
 
<P>Go window-shopping to established stores and get your info on specs, 
etc. After that buy at STEP or wherever it's cheaper. The info on the 
boxes or the price tags are often insufficient or you don't understand 
this Japanese/English high-tech babble. I'd ask the guy to open the box 
and look in the manual, otherwise I wouldn't buy. Once they have got your 
money, you can jump in the lake if something goes wrong.
 
<P>Next stop was JC-World. It's not my favorite hangout because of their 
prices, but that's where I saw an ICM 17" multi sync monitor with a dot 
pitch of 0.26mm. Can be used for DOS/V, PC-98, and 
<A HREF="http://www.info.apple.com/">Macintosh</A>. Price: 
&#165;49,800!!! Well, I haven't seen how it looks when the monitor is 
unpacked and plugged in....
 
<P>Another thing I found interesting. They had an external 
<A HREF="http://www.usr.com/">USR Sportster</A> 
28,800 for &#165;26,800. That's close to 1 Yen per baud.<g> Anyway, the box 
had all Japanese printed on it and the name "INTEGRAN" had been added. 
Furthermore, this modem was made for 100V as opposed to 117V in the USA. 
It was the first time that I saw an exclusively US-made modem for the 
Japanese market. The Sportster 14,400 might have been the first one, but 
I never saw it.
 
<P>Since it was noontime, I walked down to Lahoru, the Indian curry shop 
to have their "very hot" curry. Now, that was a "mistake"! I didn't have 
enough paper tissues with me to wipe my top and forehead, and my running 
nose.... The waitress was filling up my glass one after each other. After 
finishing I didn't know whether I ate curry, hot chocolate, or hot mud!
 
<P>Next was Spunky, which is now called ATTLA. They still carry the same 
stuff, but the good prices were missing. Maybe I didn't arrive at their 
"discount hour". Spunky did it in the past.
 
<P>My mouth and lips were still burning from the lunch, and I decided to 
close the day by having a look at A-Master, which is close to the Aum 
Shinrikyo shop (Maha Posha)... the chanting maniacs have disappeared, and 
the shop has gone too. Surprise? I don't think so.
 
<P>A-Master had a P133 from Hitachi on sale for about &#165;280,000 (FLORA). 
Also on display were <A HREF="http://www.iomega.com/">Iomega ZIP</A> drives 
for &#165;25,000. Another Iomega drive with the "Fuji" label on it was 
&#165;1,000 more. 

<P>On the way back to the station I stopped at the SEGA game center since 
there were so many people watching. A future game for the SegaSaturn 
(something called like "Virtua On") was shown on the big screen. Pretty 
exciting robo-fighter game, the best ever!
