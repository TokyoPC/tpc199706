<P>Last Christmas, my brother—who went to Vietnam, gave me—who had been in Haight Ashbury, 
the CD-ROM game <B><I>Haight Ashbury in the Sixties</I></B>.  He said, &quot;I always wondered what 
it was like there, then.&quot;</P> 
 
<P>I suppose it is a bit like my wondering what Vietnam was like for him.  I could 
watch <B><I>Platoon</I></B> and <B><I>Saigon</I></B> and read <B><I>Chickenhawk</I></B> but it would never be quite like 
watching/reading the same and remembering/being there.  The same can probably be 
said about this psychedelic CD-ROM game/documentary.  Somebody who wasn't there 
can get the feeling of the time from it but unless you had stood on the sidewalk and 
watched the parade go by, unless you had done certain other things, you probably 
wouldn't get the same chill down your spine when in  one of the video clips 
Kesey says with a laugh to a bunch of reporters &quot;Well, why don't you guys 
come by (to the acid test).&quot;</P>
 
<P>The publisher's name is Rockument and I suppose that means that they intend to 
document all the over-hyped eras of &quot;The Rock Age&quot; that each of us in 
part of our teenagerhood was cloned out of.  This one shows both the difficulty 
and some of the possibilities of trying to do that.</P>  

<P>In a very nice and careful touch, when it installed itself it told me explicitly 
that it was upgrading my MS CD interface adding a directory, changing one line 
only in the Autoexec, and telling me where it was saving the old Autoexec. Much 
more politely than most software that just says something like &quot;Your 
software/driver/boot file have been updated&quot; and allowing you to pray your 
machine will start up again.  Such friendliness was the side of the Haight which 
made life simple for the heads and gave birth to the <B><I>Whole Earth Catalog</I></B>.</P> 
 
<P>Another nice touch is how the screen can be Windows based and still eliminate the 
dreary gray (choose your color) stripes and sliding boxes at the side and bottom 
of the standard Windows format.  Color is definitely in evidence.  When you want 
to go forward or back a realistic moving hand responds to your mouse.  So simple 
you don't need pull down menus. And a Quit function is always available In the 
right bottom corner like a tab of Thorazine in your pocket.</P> 
 
<P>The colors and graphics from that time are nice even if you have largely outgrown 
that sort of thing.  One path of choice is just to run the videos, music and poster 
art as it takes you through a tour of the CD-ROM to the background music of what 
sounds mostly like the Dead.</P> 
 
<P>The other way to go through the CD (actually two CDs) -is the game &quot;Drop out.&quot;  
A nice mindless board game on a psychedelic background with four concentric circles 
marked as &quot;Food and Shelter,&quot; &quot;Hipness,&quot; &quot;Love&quot; 
and &quot;Spirituality&quot; surrounding a realistic blinking eye.  You touch the 
eye to spin a number, which either moves you along or gives you a card to draw.  You 
move with some corny whooshing sounds and several classic guitar riffs which bring 
you to either a slide show with music or the Haight's version of Chance/Community 
Chest cards.  These help you pick up points for food and shelter, hipness, love, etc.</P> 
 
<P>As much of the material was taken from the archives of the:underground newspaper 
<B><I>The Oracle</I></B>, the slices of life shown in the videos may concentrate more on 
&quot;historical&quot; figures like Kesey, Leary, Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder 
than the rock figures, maybe because rock musician video images are owned by 
corporations- But it is interesting to be reminded of groups like the Diggers that 
handed out free food in the park.  The video of the Free Clinic straight-looking 
doctor talking to the press reminds you that most of the world had short hair back 
then.  Much of the music, in bits or in long winding songs that may or may not cycle 
back on themselves, seems Dead-like, although there are bits by Joplin, Slick and 
others, that will make you feel right at home with light shows. (Remember the 
quit button is always nearby.  Unfortunately, there seems to be no SAVE button, so 
you can never &quot;SAVE your PROGRESS,&quot; but maybe that is the point.)</P> 
 
<P>The most incongruous effect is several bars that sound like the theme from Rocky when 
you gather enough points to move onward to the next circle, from Food and Shelter 
to Hipness, or from Hipness to Love.  There is some random repetition of the videos 
and you can click on the ones you have seen to hurry things up a bit.  But as you 
get deeper in the game, this seems to work less, and you get stuck listening to 
some of these long formless songs with the light shows or bad trips flashing 
at you.  And while I kept picking up spiritual &quot;points&quot; on the next to 
last row, I never seemed to be able to get enough &quot;love points&quot; to 
graduate from that circle to the spiritual circle.  The game just seemed to go 
on and on, gaining points then losing them with no advancement and not quite 
enough love. Gee, just like the real thing.</P> 
 
<P>Now there may be a deep philosophical statement to that kind of end of a game.  Maybe 
the only way you can WIN is to turn it off and go back to real life. That's what 
most of us did. If anybody comes to a different ending with this game, I would like 
to hear about it - At least I think I would.  If it was rational.  Or at least 
the description was short.  Oh, never mind.</P> 
 
<P>Is the game worth it? I don't know.  Maybe you had to have been there.  I wouldn't 
pay for it, but I am glad my brother sent me on the trip.</P>
