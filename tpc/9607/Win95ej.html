<P>I don't know if 
<A HREF="http:../members.html#Lloret.Mike">Mike Lloret</A>
 knew when he 
unearthed <A HREF="http://www.v-com.com">System Commander</A> (as reviewed last month's 
Algorithmica Japonica) that this multi-boot utility is the finest solution for installing 
bilingual versions of Windows 95 (Japanese and English). A couple 
of days after reading Mike's article, I picked up the June edition 
of <A HREF="http://www.cjmag.co.jp/">Computing Japan</A> where System Commander 
was being lauded as the solution for bilinguality. It had only been a number of months 
earlier that the same magazine was highlighting a batch routine solution whereby files 
are copied and overwritten prior to entry into either Japanese or 
English <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Windows 95</A>. The solution was extremely 
complex and not easy for the average Joe Bloggs user. Indeed, if your computer locked 
up during the copy or batch routine process; well, let's not think about it.</P>
 
<P>Having reread the article for System Commander in Computing Japan, it would appear 
that the author knows that it works, yet is unaware of the specific procedure 
required to make it work. (Please excuse me Bill if I am wrong!) The reason I 
mention this is because there is no reference to creating different logical 
drives, nor the dilemma that results from Japanese and English Windows being 
installed on the same logical drive. If you haven't determined by this stage, I 
apologize for the shock, but you must repartition and reformat your hard disk before 
you start. However, now may be the opportune time to install that SCSI 2 drive you 
have been promising yourself for the past year. If it's not, make sure you have a 
good backup of your data, whether it's on a bunch of floppies, a tape or to a 
network drive.</P> 
 
<P>The procedure is lengthy and will take about two hours. Nevertheless, when complete 
your bilingual environment will be rock solid. I have carried out the procedure on 
numerous occasions and have had no problems once the systems and boot utility have 
been properly installed. Anyway, enough of the blarney; here's what you need to do.</P> 
 
<H3>Introduction:</H3> 
 
<P>I am assuming that you, my kind reader, know a little bit about computers. If 
you are stuck at any point you may e-mail 
me <A HREF="mailto:conor@gol.com">(conor@gol.com)</A>, referencing the point 
of difficulty.</P> 
 
   <UL>
   <LI>1 copy of System Commander 
   <LI>1 copy of English Windows 95 (CD or floppies) 
   <LI>1 copy of Japanese Windows 95 (CD or floppies) 
   <LI>1 boot floppy with FORMAT.COM, FDISK.COM (preferably DOS 6.xx) 
   <LI>1 copy of you CD-ROM drivers
</UL> 
 
<H3>Before you start:</H3> 
 
<P>Do you have a CD-ROM drive? If so, make sure you have the drivers and that you know 
how to install them. If you have a CD-ROM installed (and it works), make a floppy-copy 
of your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS and CD-ROM specific files (typically, 
MSCDEX.EXE as referenced in your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CDROM.SYS as referenced in your 
CONFIG.SYS).</P> 
<P></P>
<PRE>
AUTOEXEC.BAT: 
 
C:\CDROM\MSCDEX.EXE /D:CDROM001 
 
CONFIG.SYS: 
 
DEVICE =C:\CDROM\CDROM.SYS /D:CDROM001 
/B:340 
 </PRE>
<P></P>
<H3>Overview:</H3> 
 
<P>The general procedure is as follows:</P> 
 
   <UL>
   <LI>Create two logical drives, C: and D: 
   <LI>Install English Windows 95 in C: 
   <LI>Install System Commander in C: 
   <LI>Install Japanese Windows 95 in D:
</UL> 
 
<P>Here goes:</P> 
 
   <OL>
   <LI>Boot the computer through the boot-floppy and run FDISK. 
  
   <LI>Delete all partitions. 
  
   <LI>Create a Primary DOS Partition. When prompted to set all available disk space as the partition size, 
   select NO. The primary partition (which will be your C: drive) should be 50% of the available size in MB. You 
   can easily calculate this yourself. 
    
   <LI>Now create a Extended DOS partition (which will be your D: drive). All remaining disk-space may be 
   assigned. 
    
   <LI>The last requirement from inside FDISK is to set the Primary Partition active. (This is option 2 from the 
   menu). 
    
   <LI>On exiting from FDISK the system will reboot. 
    
   <LI>Leave the boot-floppy in the PC and allow the system to boot through it again. 
    
   <LI>Format the new C: drive by typing FORMAT C: /S from A: (The /S switch copies required system files 
   from A: to C:) 
    
   <LI>When asked for a volume name (at the end of the format) input &quot;WIN95E&quot;.
    
   <LI>On the completion of formatting drive C:, proceed to format D: by typing FORMAT D: from A:. Note that 
   on this occasion there is no need for the /S switch. This drive should be given the volume name WIN95J. 
    
   <LI>If you are not using a CD-ROM please proceed directly to 13. 
    
   <LI>To install the CD-ROM drivers you may either (a) install directly from the disk that came with the CD-
   ROM drive or (b) copy the files detailed in &quot;Before you Begin&quot; to C:. Procedure (a) is trivial. Procedure (b) 
   requires that the files MSCDEX.EXE (or equivalent), CDROM.SYS (or equivalent) be in place and that the 
   drivers be loaded in AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS. (See your old versions of these files for specific 
   reference). By the end of this procedure you should be able to connect to your CD-ROM drive. 
    
   <LI>Insert the English Windows 95 SETUP disk in drive A: or the CD-ROM in drive E: and run SETUP. 
    
   <LI>When prompted for the destination directory of English Windows 95 choose the non-default C:\WIN95E. 
    
   <LI>For installation-type select &quot;TYPICAL&quot; and continue with the screen instructions. If you're doing the 
   installation via the floppy method you may want to make yourself a cup of tea. You have a long shuffle 
   ahead of you. I wouldn't bother making an emergency boot-disk if requested; making one has never saved 
   my bacon. 
    
   <LI>After the installation of English Windows 95the system will reboot and with a message saying that this 
   is the first time Windows 95 has been run. A system inspection and a degree of file thrashing thereafter 
   takes place. Finally, you are requested to reboot the system. English Windows 95 is now installed. 
    
   <LI>Insert the System Commander diskette into drive A: 
    
   <LI>From English Windows 95 escape to a DOS box (via Start, Programs, DOS-Prompt) and run 
   INSTALL.BAT from A: (A:\INSTALL). 
    
   <LI>Bypass the COLOR options by pressing ENTER and when asked if you have a BOOT DISK indicate 
   YES. Set the System Commander directory as C:\SYSCOM (or indeed, you may select the default C:\SC) 
   and continue. When asked if you are using Disk Compression say &quot;NO.&quot; 
    
   <LI>You will receive messages saying that a MultiFAT table is being created and that the Partition 
   Information is being saved. Simply press ENTER to continue. A new boot record is thereafter installed. 
    
   <LI>When asked &quot;DO YOU INTEND TO INSTALL WIN95 IN NEAR FUTURE?&quot; respond with No. If you 
   select Yes you are shown a README file which outlines potential problems with Windows 95 and other 
   operating systems. Similarly, respond with No when asked &quot;DO YOU PLAN TO INSTALL OS/2?&quot; System 
   Commander is now installed and you may Exit to DOS. 
    
   <LI>The next requirement is that you restart your computer. The system immediately recognizes the new 
   utility, displaying a &quot;Welcome to System Commander Message&quot; You are asked for your flavor of syntax for 
   your English Windows 95; anything comprehensible is OK. 
    
   <LI>System Commander asks you to input a unique directory to store the Windows 95E specific boot files. 
   I propose establishing the directory WIN95E under C:\SYSCOM for this purpose. 
    
   <LI>Having created the C:\SYSCOM\WIN95E directory, load English Windows 95 (from the newly displayed 
   menu) and thereafter Restart the computer in MS-DOS mode (Start, Shut Down,...3rd Option!). 
    
   <LI>We are now ready to start installing Japanese Windows 95. If you are using floppies simply place the 
   SETUP diskette in A: and type SETUP /IM /IS. (These switches bypass memory checks and an unnecessary 
   Scan Disk routine.). If you have a CD-ROM, place the CD-ROM in the drive and from E: type the same 
   SETUP /IM /IS. 
    
   <LI>INSTALL THE JAPANESE VERSION OF 95 in D:\WIN95J. I write this in CAPITALS as the system 
   detects the previously installed English Windows 95 and will attempt to install on top of it. If you press enter 
   at this stage you will overwrite the hour and a half of work it has taken to get to this stage. I have done this 
   a couple of times and I can assure you that it hurts. 
    
   <LI>Similar to the installation of English Windows 95 I suggest you select *hyoujun* (typical). Don't bother 
   with the emergency disk this time either. Next thing you know the system will be installing. 
    
   <LI>Enplus: Coming toward the end of the installation you may encounter an error in relation to the 
   DBSPACE.BIN and similar files. I can't recall exactly why it occurs. However, you are asked to save the file 
   (which is default), so do this, and all should be well. 
    
   <LI>Upon completion of the loading the system will reboot (directly into Japanese Windows 95) and continue 
   to configure itself. At the bottom of the screen you are notified that Windows 95 is running for the first time. 
   Like before, you have to update time zones, MS Exchange and printer options (if selected during the 
   installation). 
    
   <LI>After the installation of Japanese Windows 95, the System Commander boot record will have been 
   overwritten. This is simple to correct. Boot the system into command-line mode (by hitting F8 while booting) 
   and select Option 6. Then enter US (to change to US mode), CD C:\SYSCOM (to change to the System 
   Commander directory) and SCIN (to load System Commander Installer). 
    
   <LI>Just follow the instructions (colors are OK) and from the Main Menu (second screen), select 
   Reinstall/Update System Commander. 
    
   <LI>Exit from System Commander to DOS and reboot the computer with the CTRL-ALT-DEL keys. 
    
   <LI>Upon reboot the newly installed Japanese Windows 95 is detected (again you must correct the syntax) 
   and you are asked for a unique directory for the Japanese boot files. Select C:\SYSCOM\WIN95J. 
    
   <LI>The only thing that remains is to neatly align the System Commander boot menu.
</OL>
