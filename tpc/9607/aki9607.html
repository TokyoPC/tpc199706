<P>By the time you read this, prices on various items will have changed again (most 
likely cheaper), and new gadgets will have replaced the ones which I'm talking about 
in this article. The computer or peripheral which you purchased 3 months ago now 
counts as an oldie....</P> 
 
<P>This time I'm going to report about my unofficial solo stint in Akihabara which 
took place on June 2nd. Those who have been with me on one of my trips can truly 
imagine the difference! No running around like crazy and searching for missing 
expedition members, no head count at every street corner, no attempts to 
search for one or the other in public toilets, and no wafts of secondary smoke 
from clove cigarettes. Or was the guy attending one of the last field trips puffing 
on cotton cigars?&lt;g&gt;</P> 
 
<P>Well, this Sunday I knew exactly what I was looking for. My wife got so impressed 
with some stuff downloaded from the Internet, that she decided to do it herself. 
Of course, she CAN'T use my account since I don't use a Japanese system, and 
secondly, I'd be grounded when she spots my bookmarks and saved files... which are 
supposedly all work-related! I quickly decided to shop for a good notebook computer for 
her. Maintaining one's freedom carries a high price tag, however.</P> 
 
<P>My usual first step wasn't STEP but T-Zone's &quot;outlet&quot; at the 8th floor 
of the Minami Denki building. Anyway, the outlet floor is one floor above the 
&quot;Internet Coffee&quot; which you might want to check out, too. 
At the outlet you can find older models of laptops, notebooks, desktops, and various 
peripherals at greatly reduced prices. Of course, these gadgets are all new and 
not second hand items (except for some models on display).</P> 
 
<P>BTW, on one of the lower floors (3rd?) is a game center with over 20 computers and 
various action games. You can do car races (with steering wheel and foot pedals). 
There is a special flight simulator (seems to be a professional device) with a 
huge screen. Just drop your kids there while you shop. They won't 
miss you for the next 5 hours. The game center is never crowded as far as I can 
tell. I was there at different days and times.</P> 
 
<P>Coming back to the &quot;outlet floor&quot; (8th floor). Here are some notebook 
models and their prices:</P> 
 
<P><A HREF="http://www.compaq.com/">Compaq</A> Contura 430C DX4-100, 8MB RAM, 
420MB hard disk, PCMCIA type II, 10.4&quot; DSTN,Win 3.1 
and Word 6.0 loaded; 3 years worldwide warranty. Price: &#165;188,000 
With Win95 you'll be asked &#165;198,000.</P> 
 
<P>Another model (Contura 430C/V M420W) was around &#165;190,000 and was loaded 
with Win 3.1, <A HREF="http://www.lotus.com/">Lotus</A> Organizer, Word 6.0, Excel 5.0, etc. 
Unfortunately there was no modem included. 28.8 PC card modems 
are too expensive at &#165;34,800 for an outlet shop.</P> 
 
<P>Most Compaq notebooks I have seen have screens that are too small, and most 
models do not have a CD drive nor a built-in soundblaster or integrated stereo speakers.</P> 
 
<P>The Contura 420CX/V costs &#165;198,000. This model is equipped with a TFT 
screen and a DX4-100MHz CPU. The rest is just like model 430C/V.</P> 
 
<P>There was another gadget which I hadn't seen before. An MPC internal micro stereo 
speaker set to slide into a 5-inch drive bay. A headphone jack was also included. 
Price: &#165;2,980! It's something for people who live in a 3-tatami mat room and 
have their ears 5cm apart from each other....</P>
 
<P>Down to the 5th floor where a series of <A HREF="http://www.toshiba.com/">Toshiba</A> Dynabooks 
are on display. Model GT-S575 with a Pentium 75MHz, a 10.4-inch TFT screen, 520MB 
hard disk, PCMCIA slot, WIN95 and DOS 6.22 goes for &#165;245,000. The same model 
featuring 16MB, and a 4X CD-ROM goes for &#165;282,000. I assume that a 
soundcard and stereo speakers are included since the built-in CD-ROM wouldn't 
make much sense otherwise.</P>  
 
<P>T-Zone has some shortcomings when it comes to displaying the precise specs. Its 
sales stuff doesn't deserve 3 stars either... Still, in order to use the Internet, 
one needs a fast modem card and everything else that is needed to produce sound. Every 
component that you have to purchase additionally for a laptop computer will cost you 
an arm and a leg. Some of the &quot;good deals&quot; don't look so good anymore at all when 
calculating the final bill. For the same money or a little bit more you can have the 
newest technology and a faster CPU... if you shop around for awhile. These are all 
things which I have learned during the 6 hours I spent on comparing specs and 
prices at various shops.</P> 
 
<P>Finally I decided to give up on the DSTN models (with the lesser screen resolution) 
and look for TFT models. Very flat <A HREF="http://www.dec.com/">Digital Equipment</A> notebooks 
for not so flat wallets, top brass Dynabooks for close to bubble economy list prices, 
<A HREF="http://www.sotec.com/">Sotec</A> Winbooks for the same rip-off prices. 
The <A HREF="http://www.sharp-usa.com/">Sharp</A> Mebius series was a bit cheaper, 
but still above the price I'd have liked. The colors are even better than on the 
most expensive Dynabook models. These are truly dream notebook computers! I also 
get the strong suspicion that Toshiba tells the shops for how much they can sell off 
the old stock. Toshiba's prices are almost identical in various other shops of 
Akihabara. The same refers to the gadgets of a couple of other manufacturers.</P> 
 
<P>Then I heard the tunes of one of my favorite Credence Clearwater Revival hits.... 
The sound came from a demo CD in this <A HREF="http://www.ast.com/">AST</A> ASCENTIA (P series). 
The slide show on the stunning TFT screen was just like the one on the Mebius. 
Maybe Sharp is producing LCD screens for AST. I was already in the process to fall 
in love with this gadget, but when I saw the recommended list price of &#165;600,000 
on the pamphlet, love vanished in less than a second! Then I spotted another bad 
black &amp; white copy with prices of &#165;368,000 and &#165;398,000! While reading the 
specs, my blood pressure shot up again.</P> 
 
<P>ASCENTIA P100/P133:  &#165;368,000/398,000<BR> 
11.3-inch TFT SVGA<BR>
16MB EDO RAM (expandable to 40MB)<BR>
800MB hard disk (removable)<BR>
3-mode FDD<BR>
4X CD-ROM (removable)<BR>
Lithium-Ion battery<BR>
Soundblaster 16<BR>
PCMCIA slot: type III x 1, type II x 2<BR>
Fax-Modem: modem card 28.800 bps (included)<BR>
Ports: serial x 1, parallel x 1, VGA x 1, PS2 x 1, game x 1<BR>
Mouse: flat panel reacts on slight touch<BR>
Software loaded: <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Windows 95</A> and Windows 3.1,<BR> 
<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape</A>, <A HREF="http://www.qualcomm.com/">Eudora</A>, etc. 
(all Japanese software)<BR>
Last but not least: 3 years warranty!</P> 
 
<P>&#165;400,000 is still a lot of money, but it's worth every single dime considering 
the circumstances mentioned aforehand...&lt;g&gt;</P> 
 
<P>After that I went to the old T-Zone store to see the &quot;Topper.&quot; It's a 
notebook computer (DX4-100 with an 800MB hard disk, and 12 or 20MB RAM). Sound card 
and stereo speakers included. Price: &#165;138,000 for the 12MB model and &#165;158,000 
for the 20MB model. No CD-ROM drive. These prices are truly impressive, however, 
the screen colors were probably the worst that you can imagine. Maybe it wasn't well 
adjusted... otherwise I'd say that this is a screamer for color-blind users!&lt;g&gt;</P> 
 
<P>The shop carried <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</A> Palmtop Thinkpads 
110 from &#165;99,800 to &#165;198,000. That's probably ideal for my 
10 year old, but no good for German and other sausage fingers. There were also 
<A HREF="http://www.usr.com/">Sportster</A> Plug &amp; Play modems on 
display (some for 33.6 kps). The external model was &#165;27,400 and &#165;24,800 
for the internal unit. And there was this Sportster Vi. It's a Fax-Modem with 
personal Voice Mail feature. The internal model goes for &#165;29,800.</P> 
 
<P>The shop at the other side of the road from Attla (former Spunky) is usually not 
covered by me since it's a Macintosh outlet (one of the cheapest ones). I saw 
2 <A HREF="http://www.iomega.com/">Iomega</A> (Maxell) ZIP drives (parallel) 
for &#165;18,500. In the USA you'll pay $199.</P> 
 
<P>I'm really amazed by all these weird Akihabara shop names. Spunky on the left 
side, Kinki on the other side. Guess what they have sold before computers became a 
commodity.&lt;g&gt; Anyway, who cares for names like Za Graceful and Bless if the 
guys pray around the clock to keep the prices low....</P> 
 
<P>Finally I headed down to DOS/V Paradise since I needed another 10 floppies for 
my IOMEGA Zip drive (Epson made). 1 costs &#165;1,780, 10 are for &#165;1,650 each. 
Overtop (in the same building as TwoTop) sells them for the same price, but I don't 
like shopping in an overcrowded place like this one. Once I had to wait 20 minutes to <P>
get rid of my money! There was a <A HREF="http://www.hitachi.com/">Hitachi</A> Flora 
notebook on display. Very nice gadget, but &#165;378,000 for no modem included and 
only 1 year warranty didn't make it my choice.</P> 
 
<P>On the way back to Akihabara station I saw a modem card Suntac Ms288CF Pro for 
&#165;25,600. I don't know how good or bad it is, but 
equivalent <A HREF="http://www.usr.com/">Megahertz</A> modem cards cost &#165;10,000 more. Netscape 
endorses Megahertz in their ads....</P> 
 
<P>A week later my wife and I went down to Akihabara's T-Zone again since she should 
have the last word on her computer purchase. Since we had our younger son with us, 
we just dropped him at T-Zone's game center, the place where kids will never 
get lost!</P> 
 
<P>Arriving at T-Zone's opening time (11:00 am) has its advantages indeed. No need 
to line up as number 4 in front of a computer and no waiting times when requesting 
a salesman. The latter was needed since the AST demo notebook was the only gadget 
that wasn't switched on yet. The salesman switched it on, the program loaded and 
started to display some Intel chip demonstration. I asked the salesman to demonstrate 
the CD-ROM player including sound.</P> 
 
<P>He fiddled around for 5 minutes until I realized that his experience couldn't have 
gone far beyond operating an AM pocket radio! Since the pamphlet I saw a week before 
was gone, I asked him whether there was a soundcard in the computer. He responded 
immediately with &quot;No,&quot; but mentioned that I could purchase soundcard 
and stereo speakers optionally. When I asked him whether the visible built-in speakers 
were dummy speakers, he started again to lift the notebook, look underneath, etc.... 
Being already fed up, I called for the manager since he didn't want to. There was no 
manager, but one of his colleagues reluctantly walked over, and the incompetent 
fellow just disappeared without saying a word! The new salesman confirmed that all 
the items  were included in the package price. And since there are very few shops 
that sell AST computers, I bought everything at T-Zone. If I was after a Toshiba or 
Sharp notebook, I would not have supported salesmen who make wrong assumptions instead 
of asking their superiors. I don't care for their face-saving ceremonies if they 
waste my time and money....</P> 
 
<P>With the new notebook and 400,000 yen less in my pocket, I headed down to the exit. 
I would have gone back to the station, but my wife suddenly remembered that the 
boy was missing (innate mother instinct???). He was in the middle of a game and 
very reluctant to leave. I had to promise him not to go to Akihabara without him 
next time. No problem, I can even save the money for his lunch since he wouldn't 
notice being hungry as long as there are TV games around...&lt;g&gt;</P>
