<P>Hi, fellow TPC members!</P> 
 
<P>I like playing with PCs, but not by playing PC games.  My PC at home, whose name 
is Beauty, is used almost entirely for experiments.</P> 
 
<P>I do not do so many hardware engineering experiments, but I have enough curiosity using 
a tester and a soldering iron to fix cables and adapters to experiment with how PCs and 
peripheral devices work.  I also like to edit ini files, system files, hidden files, 
and read only files to experiment with how application software works.  In many 
cases my hypothesis or expectations are wrong and experiments fail, but it's more 
fun (I never think about things deeply).  This is the way I'm playing with my PC.</P> 
 
<P>This time,  I'm going to talk a bit about serial cables.  Serial cables — there are 
too many varieties of pin connections, shapes of connectors, and their combination.  
The differences come from which PC models are used and for which type of serial 
connection they are used.  How they are called is also very curious; very generally 
they are called serial cables, or RS-232C cables, but usually from the types of 
pin connection, they are called normal, modem, straight, cross, null, or all-pin 
connected.  It's confusing enough...and fun.</P> 
 
<P>In this AJ issue, I'll introduce the pin connection for PCs and the Apple LaserWriter 
from my pin connection library.  I've been keeping all my experiment notes for years.  
I turned the pages of my Volume 1 PC notebook (I have 2 volumes of paper notebooks 
and one electronic text file to keep records of all my experiments).</P> 

<P>According to the notebook (that was 1993), I was trying to buy a cable to connect an 
IBM compatible PC to a second-hand Apple LaserWriter Plus.  The cable was not easy 
to find, so I got pin connection information from one of my friends and made a cable.  
The pin connection is special.  It is not the standard RS-232C cable to connect PCs 
to peripheral equipment.</P> 

<P>Later on, I used the cable for a LaserWriter II NT, and it worked well.  I guess this 
cable works for all LaserWriter series, though I've had no chance to try for all the 
product line.</P> 
 
<P>If you own a LaserWriter, you can try to make the cable as described in the 
following.  Do not forget to change the LaserWriter mode from Apple Talk to RS-232C.  
Usually a LaserWriter has some dip switches (very inconvenient to change) or other 
shape of switch to change the interface mode.  You will also use the initialize 
switch (also sometimes it's needed to move up or down an inconvenient dip switch) if 
the printer is also connected to Apple Talk.</P>

<P>The cable can be made to connect to the 9-pin connector on the PC or the 25-pin 
connector on the PC.  The 9-pin to 25-pin or 25-pin to 9-pin adapters are easily 
found at PC shops, or you can make them.</P> 
 
<P>Comparing with the standard RS-232C cable that you use to connect your modem to your 
PC, you can see the difference clearly.  Here is the pin connection I checked on the 
cable connecting my husband's PC and his modem:</P>

<P>The homemade cables are only functionally efficient. But do not forget that 
unshielded cables emit noise.  This causes interference to your nearby TV, radio, 
and telephone.</P> 
 
<P>This report is just about the fact that I experimented.  If someone knows more 
logical explanations, please let me know.  I'm

the same telephone and fax number as the AJ editor.</P> 
 
<P>See you next time.</P>
