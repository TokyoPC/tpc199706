<H1>Tatami Boxes</H1>

<P>No way to live<BR> 
Is living in a tatami box<BR> 
Eating soft food<BR> 
And watching your neighbors<BR> 
Dental work deteriorate<BR> 
Like so many black stumps<BR> 
Cut down, adding noise<BR> 
For &quot;Progress!&quot;</P> 
 
<P>All kinds of money<BR> 
With nothing to spend it on<BR>
Except at inflated prices<BR> 
That never bought a great dentist<BR> 
Anyway, it pains me to see<BR>
THE POSITION that people are put<BR>
Away from home, their boxes,<BR>
Their Women and children from<BR>
The same crusted mold, and<BR>
Of course, it can't be any other<BR>
Way because that wouldn't be<BR>
Team Playing; TEAM PLAQUE,<BR>
TEAM ROOT CANAL.</P> 
 
<P>I dream of Team Japan<BR> 
Chasing me with Team Teeth<BR>
With their Team Mild 7 cigarettes<BR>
Burning my bum as I run<BR>
Towards Team Mediocrity, 'cause<BR>
I have to be a Team Player<BR>
And this Team Player<BR>
This one man &quot;Horned Devil Team&quot;<BR>
Sometimes thinks that this race<BR>
Ain't worth running.</P>
