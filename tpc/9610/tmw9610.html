<P>The Beast's pretty quiet these days, since I haven't yet managed to solve my sound 
card problem.  Nothing when using the SoundBlaster 16 but the occasional click when 
running Win95, sound overlayed with constant clicking/thumping in Win3.1, which starts 
from the moment the system boots.  Better than what I get with 
the <A HREF="http://www.creaf.com/zonemenu.html">AWE32 PNP</A>, though: 
a black screen without even the BIOS information... it just doesn't start at all.  
Well, as in much of life, there's good news and bad news.  Creative Labs responded very quickly to my internet e-mail to their tech support.  They suggested I 1) try the boards in a different computer, 2) try the boards in a computer which has nothing on it but DOS, 3) 
contact <A HREF="http://www.gw2k.com/">Gateway 2000</A>.</P> 

<P>Unfortunately, the only suitable computer I have around is Beauty, and since I can't 
understand how the (perfectly functioning) soundboard already in it was set up, I'm 
reluctant to replace it to experiment; I don't have complete confidence that I could put 
it back the way it was.  My favorite scientist/engineer is willing to experiment on her 
machine, but I'm not.</P> 

<P>I don't have any machines lying around that have nothing but DOS on them, either, and 
I've already contacted Gateway.  I'm still waiting for an answer after a week, though their 
immediate (automatic e-mail) acknowledgment told me that all tech support questions get 
answered in order of receipt.</P> 

<P>On the bright (?) side, Creative's well-meant but basically useless advice message will 
come in handy as an example to use in one of my technical writing courses.  It was sent 
from Singapore, and appears to have been written by someone who's English ability is just 
about that of my higher-level trainees'.  Understandable enough, but not perfect; it'll 
make a nice editing exercise.</P> 

<P>It did make me wonder a bit about what tech support people's image of the user is, 
though.  Do they imagine that most people have several PCs among which they can switch 
cards or other components, or that the typical user has a spare DOS-only PC he/she keeps 
for troubleshooting?  Hell, I work for a computer company, and nobody has that much 
spare gear around outside of the labs and development divisions.</P> 

<P>I'm not sure whether it's good or bad news, but my sound card troubles have now 
coincided with the long-delayed delivery of <A HREF="http://www.bethsoft.com/">Bethesda Softworks'</A> new game, their much-talked-about sequel to The Elder Scrolls: Arena, which was a big prize-winner a couple of years ago.  The new one's called The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall, and seems to be much bigger and better than the its predecessor.</P>   

<P>A first-person medieval-fantasy RPG, it carries on the developers' policy of giving the 
player a lot of freedom of action.  There is a very complex plot line with all sorts of 
intrigues, betrayals, seductions, madness, and so on, but the player can ignore that and 
instead choose to play whatever role he/she pleases.</P>   

<P>With eight distinct races; 18 character classes (warrior, sorcerer, thief, etc.), 
plus the ability to custom-make characters — you could conceivably play a lizard-like 
amphibious spellcasting burglar with the ability to turn into a wereboar, for example — (!); 
thousands of items of clothing, armor, weaponry, jewelry, books, etc.; innovative gizmos 
like a spellmaker for concocting homebrewed spells or an item maker for making your own 
enchanted weapons/armor/rings/etc.; and an enormous &quot;world&quot; in which to explore, 
buy usable property like ships, houses, horses, or wagons; right wrongs or perpetrate them 
in any of 16,000 cities, towns, villages, crypts, castles, underwater grottoes, and 
you-name-its, there are a lot of roles that could be played, for a good long time.</P> 

<P>The graphics are really great, too, from what I've seen so far (it installed easily 
and I spent a couple of hours exploring before duty called).  There's some partial 
frontal nudity and realistically messy gore (the corpse of a monster killed with a war 
hammer looked it); there's also a ChildGuard filter.  Highly recommended, if you're into RPGs.</P> 

<P>I understand that the sound effects and music are especially good, too...</P>
