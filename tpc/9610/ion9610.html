<H3>Only Communicate</H3> 
 
<P>The Ionic Column tends to be a sort of journal of me and my PC. New hardware, new 
software, new programs, plus some comments on new developments gleaned from the 
various BBS or technical magazines. I do not have much to report on for this month, 
mainly due to the fact that I have been heavily involved in my &quot;paying hobby,&quot; 
and thus further work on OS/2 has been put on the back burner for a month. A future issue 
is likely to concern ISDN, as I am moving office shortly and will install ISDN instead of 
two conventional lines. Apart from the speed, it costs about the same as I pay for two 
analog phone lines.</P> 
 
<H3>The Information Superhighway (sic)</H3> 

<P>It is not really such a new concept, as members of TPC will know. Tokyo has had its 
BBS for many years now, acting as a vital forum and virtual meeting point even before 
the concepts were popularized. Too bad nobody got around to trade-marking that delightful 
term &quot;virtual cafe&quot; coined by former TPC newsletter maven Andreas Braem.</P> 
 
<P>The key issues in connectivity are both low-tech and high-tech. The high-tech part 
is the provision of systems that can communicate relatively quickly and easily. The 
question that I would ask is: why has all this had to wait for Pentium PCs stuffed to 
the gills with mega-wads of RAM and connected to high-speed modems or ISDN? The 
technology to communicate was available ten years ago, but it was not easy to use. 
The low-tech part is price and availability. The whole thing has mushroomed and reached 
critical mass now that prices have plummeted and the technology is easy / easier to 
use. And more fun.</P> 
 
<P>No one element is that new. Online services such 
as <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com/">Compuserve</A> have been around for 
years, but they used to be so expensive. The Internet was restricted to academia and 
government institutions until just a few years ago. What would have happened if it 
had been made available to the general public earlier? The Internet is now much more 
than file transfer and e-mail, but those two alone could be done with 2,400bps modems 
and the older file transfer protocols.</P> 
 
<P>Looking at the various BBS today, it would have been nice to have had ZMODEM 
and mail readers (widely) available ten years ago. Around that time I was stuck 
with a 300bps modem, but we all typed on-line anyway. It was not all that expensive 
if one lived in Tokyo, since we lived on-line at local call rates.</P> 

<P>The funny thing is that we are returning to that with the Internet and the World 
Wide Web, assuming that you can find a provider on your immediate vicinity. In 
the same way, watching the pages appear on my screen at 14,400 bps reminds me 
somewhat of the old days of watching the text crawl across the screen with a 300 or 
1,200bps modem.</P>  
 
<P>In case I make it sound that the only progress has been in terms of the appearance 
of the text rather than its content, I hasten to add that graphics can be vitally 
important to communicate information. Needless to add, graphics were out of the question 
with the older slower modems, although there were some very ingenious example of art made 
up of ASCII characters. Is there a computer user on this planet who has not seen the 
ASCII Raquel Welch?</P> 
 
<P>I'll give just one example of information that requires graphics. Vendors of 
computer-related products used to quote a phone number, and maybe a fax number. A 
few die-hards even quoted telex or telegraph numbers. A sales inquiry or a desperate 
plea for technical help meant a phone call or a fax. Many vendors automated these 
procedures with the soulless labyrinths of voice mail or fax on demand. An increasing 
number then offered BBS for technical support and file downloads of upgrades and bug 
fixes. The BBS were usually located in the USA and you first had to be registered, 
which meant waiting a day for allocation of a password to allow you to download 
anything, but it was quicker than waiting for a set of diskettes.</P>  
 
<P>These days I can get sales brochures from the vendor's Web homepage instead of 
shooting off a fax and waiting for an envelope to arrive—eventually—maybe.  I can 
also get what I want by simply viewing the homepage; downloading the image for 
printout later is like paying somebody else to fax something to me, though, I can 
shoot off sales or technical queries to the vendor's Internet account, to an online 
service, or through their Web homepage again. If I need updated drivers or the like, 
I can also download them from Compuserve or from the vendor's Internet number by 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) at local instead of international telephone rates. 
It is quicker and cheaper even with my 14,400bps modem. Once I get ISDN, I will 
use the Web much more.</P> 
 
<H3>PTT</H3> 

<P>PTTs worldwide used to make much more money on their telephone services than in 
delivering bits of paper. The term is used to describe a state-run monopoly that 
covered post, telephones and telegraphic transfers, and it was also the name by 
which the French post office was known. In many countries the two sections were split, 
and then privatized separately. Thus Germany has Deutsche Bundespost, which retained 
the hunting horn logo and the paper-shuffling business, and Telekom handles 
telecommunications. Neither of these are exactly customer-oriented. It's somewhat like 
dealing with a Third World embassy.</P> 
 
<H3>Virtual phone calls</H3> 

<P>Telekom has been plagued with frauds concerning over-billing and misuse of 
phone numbers, as I well know from personal experience; I got a phone bill for 
415 DM (US$250) for three days of calls placed just before my arrival in Germany. 
Perhaps they assumed that I had made virtual phone calls. I had to pay the bill, 
but finally got the amount credited in full after sending off a fiery missive or 
two. Their monopoly ends next year, and phone costs are predicted to be halved in 
the areas where the newcomers can compete. I am keen to find out how international calls 
will be affected, although this is less of an issue than before due to Compuserve and the Net.</P> 
 
<H3>Cutting postage costs—legally</H3> 

<P>I thought that Japanese postage was expensive, but Germany is not exactly cheap. 
And becoming less so. The rates are due to go up within a few months, which will 
due a great deal to encourage the use of faxes and e-mail. I can send a one-page 
fax locally or within Europe for a third of the price of a letter. It will soon be a 
quarter of the price of a letter. The ratio is slightly less for international 
calls outside Europe. I initially cut costs by faxing instead of sending snail-mail, 
but I have made a bigger saving by sending e-mail through Compuserve in the past year.</P>  
 
<H3>Cutting postage costs—illegally</H3> 

<P>Talking of cutting postage costs, a scam that is being perpetrated over the Internet 
is an offer to show you how to do just that. In return for a fee of around $20, you 
get a letter mailed with a 2c stamp, saying that you can mail a letter at this bargain 
rate. The scam? The automatic sorting systems reject letters with no stamps, but accept 
mail that has a stamp on it, even if it less than the full amount. It requires the 
human eyeball, Mark 1, to recognize the problem, but the odds are that most of these 
letters will get through.</P> 

<H3>A load of baloney</H3> 

<P>Scams like this offer you useless information for a small fee. Since the amounts are so 
small, nobody bothers much, but it does add up. It is another example of the &quot;salami 
principle,&quot; often used to defraud computerized accounting systems, in which a 
very small amount is sliced away somewhere in the system, but a great many times.</P> 
 
<H3>Life on-line</H3> 

<P>By and large, you only need one on-line service. I use Compuserve, and have wondered 
from time to time whether to sign up for Germany's very own T-Online, or to look for 
America OnLine (AOL), which I think is represented in Germany by T-Online. All the 
services interconnect, and also the &quot;T&quot; in T-Online stands for Telekom, a 
company that is not my favorite vendor. Compuserve has Internet access, so I can send 
mail through the Internet, and also receive it. By the virtual sackful.</P> 
 
<H3>The Uselessnet</H3> 

<P>Again, I borrow a phrase from a TPCer, Peter Evans, who took a very jaundiced view 
of the relentless e-selling via the Internet in a recent BBS posting. Other BBS postings 
showed me that &quot;spam&quot; (now without trademark or capitalization) is not merely a 
meat product beloved of Pythons, but also a verb. And a verb much used and abused by the 
blowhard salespersons of the Net, who seize upon lists of names and numbers to feed into their 
junk e-mail machines. At least they don't waste paper, but I waste a few minutes every day 
wading through the cyber-junk. The funny thing is that many of them seem to be trying to 
sell to each other, and to push others to do the same. An e-mail program shoots out 
thousands of messages to hapless Netizens, offering them a chance to buy the same bulk 
mailing software and &quot;guaranteed&quot; lists of e-mail addresses to sell to the 
virtual community at large.</P> 

<H3>Cyber-scams?</H3> 

<P>Every day brings a crop of offers to get rich quick. Some offer information, others 
a chance to get involved in marketing schemes which require you to recruit umpteen more 
people before you stand to make any money. Some even begin with a rundown on the various 
sales schemes and scams jostling for space in my mailbox. It is a bit like the junk mail 
that I used to receive by the ton in Tokyo, but more democratic. The Net may be a good 
way to sell niche products or to make direct sales that also make savings by cutting out 
the middleman, but you might be forgiven for thinking that the Internet is nothing but a very 
cheap way of shotgunning sales offers at a great many people, and supposedly, a 
well-heeled market segment with a relatively high level of disposable income at that. 
Despite the size of the Internet, it still seems a very incestuous business in which 
everybody is trying to sell something to each other. Is that really the way to get rich quick?</P> 

<H3>Put up or pay up</H3> 

<P>The Internet is already under pressure to either restrict advertising or to charge for 
its own services. A couple of the bulk mailer vendors commented that there are a number of 
vocal &quot;Net police&quot; who make life miserable in a virtual sort of way for the 
Net-marketers. I must admit that I do not welcome the flood of sales literature that I 
get, especially when it is very US-specific, but sometimes there are useful things as 
well. The ones that irritate me the most are those hopefuls who think I will waste time 
on an 800- call to the USA (only possible outside the USA if you are registered with a 
callback service), calling up a fax auto-responder or pointing your browser at their Web 
homepage. The only good thing I can say is that at least they do not waste paper.</P> 

<P>But the real prize for chutzpah has to go to the hard-driving salesman in Tokyo who 
left a message on my answering machine, asking me to call him back urgently. I did so, 
and got a sales pitch for Persian carpets. It's much the same as being asked by e-mail 
to fax for sales information or to ring up at my expense and listen to a tape. I wouldn't 
waste the time even if my telephone was free, which it assuredly is not.</P> 

<P>Of course, this is a very democratic business. Time and distance make no difference 
on the Net, so TPC readers in Japan and I all get the same mail. Curiously, none of 
the e-mailers seem to know that US Compuserve account numbers always begin with a 7, 
and elsewhere in the world with a 1.</P> 

<P>That's all for the moment. I hope to have some comments on digital cameras and 
imaging in the next issue, as I will be helping out an exhibitor at Photokina in Cologne. 
It will also be interesting to see if I get any feedback on this article from someone 
reading the TPC Web homepage.</P>
