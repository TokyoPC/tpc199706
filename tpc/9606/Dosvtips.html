<H1>DOS/V Tips You Can Use</H1>

<P>I recently received a new used computer on my desk at school.  It's an old 
<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</A> PS/2 Model 70 
with a hard disk of 60 megabytes and 6 megs of RAM.  Not a powerful machine by today's 
standards, but adequate for my word processing needs.  I installed IBM's PC DOS 
version 6.0 and as I did so I learned a few things that I think others should know too.</P> 
 
<P>Some programs will only work under the English environment of DOS.  Usually these are 
English DOS programs like utilities.  <A HREF="http://www.interplay.com/index.html">Descent</A>, 
the popular 3D game guaranteed to make you dizzy and which everybody should have on 
their work computer for those late night &quot;overtime&quot; hours, will not work under DOS/V.  
To use such a program you have to change environments.  There are two ways to 
do this: <B>&quot;Switch&quot;</B> and <B>&quot;Chev&quot;</B>.</P> 
 
<P>By default, the initial language of DOS/V is Japanese.  In order to move to 
English utilizing the latter method, one must type a no-doubt ethnocentric command, 
<B>&quot;chev us&quot;</B>.  While to change back one must type <B>&quot;chev jp&quot;</B>. The <B>Chev</B> command, 
literally meaning &quot;change environment to US (United States equals English, 
desho?) /jp (Japan equaling Japanese is not so much of a problem for 
me),&quot; also causes the computer to change from one language to the other but it 
does so without rebooting through autoexec.bat and config.sys. I like to use this 
command because it changes language environments quickly and without forcing you to 
turn off your computer.  This is especially useful when you are working in 
Japanese Windows and you need to quickly use an English DOS program of the kind 
described above.  You jump to the DOS prompt, type Chev and then you can start your 
program.</P> 
 
<P>The <B>&quot;Switch&quot;</B> command causes the computer to reboot through config.sys and 
autoexec.bat, and changes the onscreen language from Japanese to English, or 
vice-versa.  This means you cannot use it from inside of Windows because the 
process of rebooting will close Windows and any programs you are running, thus 
losing any information that has not been saved.  I believe you use this one 
when you have two sets of Windows on your machine, one the English version and the 
other the Japanese version.  It goes without saying that each Windows version will 
only run under its corresponding DOS language environment.</P> 
 
<P>To install tools you did not select in the beginning installation, type 
<B>&quot;setup /e&quot;</B> at the DOS prompt.</P> 
 
<P>If you have a mouse that the computer has not detected for some reason, add this line      
anywhere in your autoexec.bat file &quot;c:\dos\mouse&quot;, click the &quot;save&quot; 
option and then reboot the computer.  This tells the computer to use the mouse driver 
provided with DOS as the driver for your mouse.</P> 
 
<P>There is a free utility included with DOS that is not automatically installed.  
This is called RAMBOOST.  It optimizes your RAM when your computer boots up.  Perhaps 
it speeds up my computer; I can't really tell, but I am willing to try anything 
to make this thing go faster.</P>
