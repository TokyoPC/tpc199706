<H1>Computers are Fun?</H1>
<P>
</P>
<H2>by Roland Hechtenberg</H2>
<HR>

<H3>Monday, April 8:</H3> 
<P>Trying to save a file during work, I get the friendly message that 
drive C: is not accessible or not present. Fortunately I can save my work to 
drive F:, the <A HREF="http://www.syquest.com/">SyQuest</A>. Shutting down, I get a 
few more messages that drive C: is absent.</P> 
 
<P>When I pull the removable hard disk from the computer, it feels hot enough to fry 
eggs on it. OK, so I pop in another hard disk and get the message: <B>Optimizing hard 
disk, this can take from 10 to 20 minutes.</B> The hard disk lamp is flashing 
impressively and things look normal, except for the progress indicator on 
the screen, which isn't moving. After 30 minutes, I decide to interrupt the 
process and try to have the hard disk auto-detected. The report that the 
(new 540 MB) hard disk has 0 MB, 0 cyls., 0 heads, and 0 sectors is 
not very encouraging.</P> 
 
<P>By now the other hard disk has cooled down, and I try them both on the children's 
computer upstairs. Both disks are recognized without problems, which indicates 
to me that the E-IDE controller is out of kilter. After another 30 hectic minutes, 
the children's computer has been reconfigured as my main computer, so 
that I can continue work, while the children have to use their Famicon.</P> 
 
<P>This gives me a sufficient excuse to upgrade to 
a <A HREF="http://www.intel.com/">Pentium</A>. I already have been 
studying DOS/V magazine for a few months, so I know what I want: A Pentium 150 
with a 1.2 GB <A HREF="http://www.wdc.com/">Western Digital</A> hard 
disk, 32 MB memory (which I already have), a 
combined 3.5 and 5" floppy (also already present), an 
internal <A HREF="http://www.nakamichi-corp.com:80/index.html">Nakamichi</A> 4-changer 
(present), an N606 case with three open 5" and 3.5" bays each, a keyboard 
connector at the front, and a construction with a swivel joint at the rear top, 
so that you can swing the top and front upwards for better access to 
the motherboard and the drives.</P> 
 
<P>For the motherboard, I had decided to get the P54TS 
by <A HREF="http://www.iwill.com/Index.html">IWILL</A>, which has fast SCSI-II equivalent to the 
<A HREF="http://www.adaptec.com/">Adaptec</A> 2940 integrated into the board.</P> 
 
<H3>Thursday, April 11:</H3> 
<P>Before the TPC meeting, I normally do my Akihabara shuffle, 
and today I come well equipped with one large bag, one medium bag, a small 
backpack, and two wallets.</P> 
 
<P>After two hours of checking various shops, I am ready to buy. One P54TS, one 
Pentium 150, one removable hard disk drawer, one N606 case (to be sent by 
Takkyubin), an external SCSI connector, and one sound card as the required parts for 
my new computer. I also buy a new 486 motherboard and 
a <A HREF="http://www.cyrix.com/">Cyrix</A> 120 for my 
spare computer, two SIMM savers, a 4-speed 3-disk changer (15,000 Yen), 
and <A HREF="http://www.qdeck.com/">CleanSweep</A>.</P> 
 
<H3>Saturday, April 13:</H3> 
<P>After careful study of the various manuals, I begin the assembly.</P> 
 
<P>First I format and prepare the hard disk on my work computer.</P> 
 
<P>Then I install the CPU on the motherboard and motherboard in the case. So far, 
there are no problems, but the motherboard manual indicates that a Pentium 150 
needs a VRM (Voltage Regulator Module), and I have no such thing. On the other 
hand, I seem to remember that VRMs went out of fashion before ever 
coming into use. So I say a short prayer and hope for the best. The motherboard 
comes with a musical fan cooler clamped to the CPU socket and with its own 
connector close to the CPU socket.</P> 
 
<P>The SIMM savers I bought can't be installed in bank 0 because of space 
restrictions, but they can be installed in bank 1.</P> 
 
<P>The floppy installation and the hard disk rack also present no problems, and the 
video card fits well into the PCI slot.</P> 
 
<P>Of the various cables belonging to the case, I can figure out where to connect 
the reset switch, the HDD busy indicator, and the speaker cable, but I can't find 
the connector for the power indicator, and I am not sure how to connect the key 
lock or if I should connect the turbo switch and the Turbo LED, so I bunch 
these cables together and decide to forget about them.</P> 
 
<P>The on-board connectors for hard disks, floppies, COM ports, and printer all 
have an enclosure around them, which makes connection of the cables easier.</P> 

<P>I decide to test the computer in this mini-configuration, because if it doesn't 
work, any additional installation work will be just a waste of time anyway.</P> 
 
<P>I connect the display, the keyboard, and the power cables, say a short prayer, and 
switch on the main power switch. I hear no beeping or strange noises and see no 
sparks, so after one second of joy, I realize that I have made a serious mistake, 
and after checking that the hard disk is not being accessed, I immediately 
switch off the main switch and connect the power connector of the cooling fan.</P> 

<P>Switching the power on, I get a gratifying short blast of the musical warning before 
the fan reaches normal speed. The screen indicates a Pentium 150, 32 MB of memory, 
and a 1.2 GB hard disk, and Scandisk shows no problems. By now it is half past 
one in the morning, and I decide to call it a day.</P> 
 
<H3>Sunday, April 14:</H3> 
<P>I install the <A HREF="http://www.nakamichi-corp.com:80/index.html">Nakamichi</A> 4-changer 
and the soundboard, as well as the external SCSI connector, all without a hitch, 
and extensive testing, especially of the SCSI-drives, shows only one problem. 
The motherboard has a PS2 connector for a mouse, and although diagnostics show 
that the connector is there, no mouse can be found when connected there, while 
all of them are recognized easily on COM1. Perhaps I have not connected the 
internal mouse connector correctly, but as this is no problem, and as my work 
is starting to stack up, I decide not to worry about it.</P> 
 
<P>The SCSI part of the motherboard works like a dream. The Nakamichi 7-disk 
changer, the Nakamichi 4-disk changer, and the PD-drive are recognized as 7 drives, 
4 drives, and 2 drives respectively, without any need for special drivers, and I add 
the SyQuest driver only to be on the safe side.</P> 
 
<P>For the time being, I am rather happy with my new computer, although it can be 
disconcerting when you want to access the hard disk after typing for an hour or two 
and nothing happens, until you realize that the "green" features have been activated 
and your hard disk has to wake up first.</P> 
 
<P>The next time I have some time at my hands, I'll try to install the 486 motherboard 
and the 3-disk changer (unless one of the computers decides to act up again).</P> 
 
<P>Aren't computers fun!?</P> 
 
<P>When I wrote the article, I had searched for my receipts, but couldn't find them, 
but thanks to Mike's request, I searched again (and again) and found them, which 
is also good for tax purposes. I'll try it first the easy way and give you a list 
of the shops, the parts, and the prices.</P>
