<P>The TPC is about to get a new Voicemail system to handle calls coming into the 
TPC hotline.  This is a brief review of what I saw at 
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Cotton.Ken">Ken Cotton's</A>
 place where the 
thing is under test:</P> 
 
<P>The computer is a plain vanilla <A HREF="http://www.compaq.com/">Compaq</A> 486.  
Inside is a new type of card 
from <A HREF="http://www.spectrumsignal.wimsey.com/index.html">Spectrum Signal Processing</A>, called 
Spectrum Office F/X ($279 mail order)... this is the exact same card as one of the 
OMRON cards which Ken showed me just to prove it!!  It is apparently selling like 
hotcakes in Japan at &#165;20,000.  (If the Japanese were ever behind in 
implementing PC technology, they aren't any more...)</P> 
 
<P>The Office F/X card incorporates 16-bit WAV and MIDI audio it uses an IBM Mwave DSP, 
which gives it more realistic wavetable MIDI sound, than some other voicemail products in 
magazine reviews.</P> 
 
<P><A HREF="http://www.pcmag.com">PC Magazine</A> in April 25, 1995 
reviewed this board quite favorably.  Rick Rettig also raves about it; he is an 
independent telephony consultant with long experience in Tokyo....</P> 
 
<P>The Office F/X multifunction I/O card combines a fax modem, telephone 
management features, and automatically detects and assigns IRQ and DMA 
settings via software.  As a regular sound card it would be ok....  
32-voice wavetable synthesis 
and <A HREF="http://www.creaf.com/zonemenu.html">Sound Blaster</A> emulation.</P> 
 
<P>It comes with the following software:</P> 
 
<P>SwitchBoard—telephone management software which is a programmable voicemail 
system like those we all have grown so fond of, when calling for service at 
the US Embassy, software companies, etc.  All incoming messages, including 
faxes, E-mail and phone messages, are stored in a folder hierarchy.  You can 
establish hierarchies of voice mailboxes.  It can thus support offices that 
conduct multiple types of business or that distribute various information 
to incoming callers.</P> 
 
<P>Delrina <A HREF="http://www.symantec.com/">WinFax and WinComm</A> Lite—fax 
and modem programs.</P> 
 
<P>MKS Internet Anywhere—E-mail front end.</P> 
 
<P>Discriminator—a utility which automatically determines whether an incoming 
call is voice, data or fax and routes it to the appropriate receiving software.</P> 
 
<P>Office F/X supports data and fax transmissions at 14.4 kilobits per second 
(Kbps), and V.34, 28.8-Kbps data transmission.  I watched Ken log into the 
machine with <A HREF="http://www.symantec.com/">PC Anywhere 32</A>, which 
is the latest and greatest remote control software in the universe!! I was 
totally awed by this setup which can do everything I would want to do, 
on a single line.</P> 
 
<P>It did seem to be struggling under <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Win95</A> with 
8MB of RAM installed.  It requires you to load all the software at once, and 
seemed to be paging to disk a bit....</P>
