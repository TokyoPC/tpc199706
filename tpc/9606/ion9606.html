<H4>Englishman David Parry lived in Tokyo from 1980 to 1994 and was 
a member of TPC from 1986. A frequent contributor to this publication, 
he was Newsletter Publisher from late 1988 to early 1990 and 
began the Ionic Column in 1992. This column has won a prize and 
an honorable mention in newsletter awards. To the Tokyo BBS community, 
he now lives in virtual cyberspace and teleports textually over the 
ether. On the physical level, he currently lives and works in D&uuml;sseldorf, 
that part of Germany that most resembles Japan.</H4> 
 
<H3>The Remains of the Day</H3>  
 
<P><B>(CeBIT '96, part 3)</B></P> 
 
<P>CeBIT really was too big, but it looks as if I will be able to see some of the 
things I missed if I go to a forthcoming show in D&uuml;sseldorf in early June. 
Imprinta offers &quot;Prepress and more: Technology for the media,&quot; with sections on 
layout design, image production, multimedia, database publishing (probably with 
text indexing / retrieval and optical / image databases), text and image 
processing, data communication (and networks), and a fair bit for the printing 
industry. I'm sure that much of this was at CeBIT, but I did not have time to see it.</P>  
 
<H3>Framed?</H3> 
 
<P>I hope that <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe and / or Frame</A> are exhibiting, 
as I want to winge at them about their tardy support of FrameMaker after their merger. 
About three weeks ago I sent out an urgent request for the European 
hyphenation dictionary. The standard product only hyphenates English, the sole choice 
being the side of the Atlantic. It does a less than satisfactory job of 
hyphenating German, and I have a German DTP ready for delivery. Hand-hyphenated. 
An e-mailed whine to Frame eventually produced a CC of a message from 
somebody at Adobe to somebody in Germany who was supposed to help me. I'm still waiting.</P> 
 
<H3>Maxed Out on <A HREF="http://www.qualitas.com/">Qualitas</A></H3> 
 
<P>For years I used 386 to the Max, an excellent 
memory manager that I preferred to <A HREF="http://www.qdeck.com/">QEMM</A>. From time 
to time I also used QEMM, mainly because it can be used with Japanese systems. 
Qualitas creates work files during optimization with the extension &szlig;AK. 
Not BAK, replacing the B with ASCII 225 (&szlig;). This versatile character can be 
read either as beta (the second letter of the Greek 
alphabet) or ess-tset, the German character that is used instead of &quot;double s&quot; 
in words such as Stra&szlig;e (Strasse = &quot;street&quot;).</P>  
 
<H3>&szlig;SE</H3>  
 
<P>On Japanese systems it has another function that has to do with kanji and sends 
everything haywire. &szlig;SE in the PC? The result is that you cannot use 
386 to the Max for DOS/V or the like. I had pointed this out 
to Qualitas while in Japan, and again while I was at CeBIT, but they don't 
seem to be too worried about it.</P> 
 
<P>Qualitas had been very helpful over the years if I had problems, and were not 
predatory about upgrades. When I asked about upgrading to version 7.00 from 
version 6.00, they said that I was welcome to do so, but 
it was not really necessary because I was still using DOS 5.00. On the other 
hand, I could get an upgrade to version 6.03 from them free from their BBS or 
on diskette for a very nominal price. That is the kind of 
treatment I appreciate. But despite that, I no longer use Max.</P> 
 
<H3>Deep-Sixed</H3> 
 
<P>A few months ago I moved over 
to <A HREF="http://www.helixsoftware.com/">Netroom (Helix Software)</A>. 
When I wanted to upgrade to DOS 6.22 last year, I decided that I would try 
Netroom. Firstly, because it had very good reviews, secondly, because 
I would probably have to pay almost as much to upgrade 386 to the Max to version 
7.00, and thirdly because I wanted to use the Helix cloaked utilities, and I 
felt they would work better with Netroom than a third-party product.</P> 
 
<H3>Disk Technician (Y/N?)</H3> 
 
<P>I expected that a few older programs might have trouble with DOS 6.22, primarily 
disk or memory utilities. To date, the only problems are with one or two old 
diagnostic programs that have been superseded, and Disk Technician. The latter 
was supposed to keep your hard disk fit and healthy, but alas, the company 
(latterly of the same name) must have failed to do the same financially, as 
I have not been able to trace it. The funny thing is that I recall a statement to 
the effect that they had been taken over Seagate, who are still 
very much in business. Disk Technician refuses to run under DOS 6.xx, so now it 
has been archived in the cellar.</P> 
 
<H3>Cloak and Dagger</H3> 
 
<P>I have mentioned the Helix cloaked utilities in a previous column, so I will 
only touch on them briefly. In non-technical terms and speaking more as a user, 
cloaking allows programs to run in high memory, but in a way that is more efficient 
and reliable than simply loading them high. The utilities include a cloaked 
cache, mouse driver, screen accelerator and CD-ROM driver.</P>  
 
<H3>Lose Your CD-ROM</H3> 
 
<P>The cloaked cache needs a lot of memory to work properly, more than SmartDrive, 
but it takes up less conventional memory. The screen driver only works under DOS, 
so it may not be so useful these days. The mouse driver is based on 
the <A HREF="http://www.logitech.com/">Logitech</A> driver, but 
works well with Microsoft rodents. The pi&eacute;ce de r&eacute;sistance is the CD-ROM driver, 
which is a complete substitute for MSCDEX. It does not need to run under 
Netroom, but might be a little more reliable when used with its mate from Helix. That 
one driver is worth the price of the cloaked utilities alone, and both the utilities 
are Netroom are inexpensive.</P>  
 
<P>The cloaked utilities slash the amount of memory required, so I got 610-620K 
free after loading the CD-ROM and network drivers and a lot more besides. The 
figure dropped after I changed to the <A HREF="http://www.contourdes.com/index.htm">Contour</A> mouse 
driver in order to get the full programmable mouse functions, but the Contour 
mouse will run perfectly happily with standard <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A> or 
Logitech drivers, cloaked or otherwise. Like most three-button 
mice, this one has a switch for two- or three-button operation.</P> 
 
<H3>Legal Highs</H3> 
 
<P>Netroom also loads <A HREF="http://www.novell.com/">Netware</A> drivers high, 
without drama. This surprised me, since in general it is risky 
to load NETX high with other memory managers. The only two quirks relate to my 
Pentium and to missing drivers. Firstly, the system always hangs during optimization. 
The manual warns you that this may happen, and tells you to reboot. You then get a 
message saying that the system stopped prematurely, and would you please reboot again? 
Then it works. The 486/66 does not have this problem, the two (identical) Pentiums 
do. But it is a minor problem, and in the end the only result is that optimization takes 
longer.</P>  
 
<H3>Mouse Brings Down Network</H3> 
 
<P>The other problem is a bit tedious: if the mouse has been removed for some reason, 
the Netware drivers fail to load. The failure to load the mouse driver, due to a 
missing mouse, has a cascade effect on other drivers, but most notably the Novell 
ones. I did not have this problem with Max, but then I was unable to load the drivers 
high. Again, this is more of an irritation than anything else, and it is not really 
the fault of the program.</P> 
 
<H3>Looking Back</H3> 
 
<P>By and large I am very happy with Netroom. It extracts more free memory than any 
other memory manager that I know of, and is generally reliable and stable. I would not 
go back to 386 to the Max unless it offered something better and total compatibility 
with the cloaked utilities. Version 8.00 of Max is out, but while my initial impression 
was that it would be worth trying, my new subscription 
to <A HREF="http://www.pcmag.com/">PC Magazine</A> saved 
me money right from the start. A review of Max indicated that it did not have 
significant improvements over older versions or the competition, and that it 
certainly did not do anything clever with Windows. To that extent it is misleading.</P> 
 
<H3>Keeping It Straight</H3> 
  
<P>Max 8.0 claims to straighten out Windows in the same way 
that <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/">RAM Doubler</A> does. It does not. All 
the memory managers such as Max or QEMM do a certain amount of optimization involving 
Windows, but this is primarily a question of reserving or reclaiming certain areas 
in memory. RAM Doubler deals with one specific aspect of Windows, the 
System Resources. Max and the others do not touch this, as far as I have been able 
to fathom. In short, Max does not do it all, current advertising to the contrary. 
You still need RAM Doubler together with your memory manager. That said, Max 
is a top-line memory manager and Qualitas give good support.</P> 
 
<H3>Out the Window</H3> 
 
<P>RAM Doubler primarily recycles and reclaims memory that Windows 
otherwise &quot;loses.&quot; In short, it is yet another utility that correct 
programming sloppiness by Microsoft. It does not &quot;double the amount of 
memory in your system&quot;, as the ads initially claimed, but it does genuinely 
help. I notice far fewer crashes, and I can run more windows programs 
simultaneously. The program is not expensive and is highly recommended for 
die-hards like myself still using Windows 3.1. A version also exists for 
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Windows 95</A>, although that 
maintains better control over memory usage than its profligate predecessor.</P> 
 
<H3>Revisiting the Mouse</H3> 
 
<P>The <A HREF="http://www.contourdes.com/index.htm">Contour</A> mouse is nice. It really is much 
tiring to use. Apart from the fact that I don't use the cloaked mouse driver 
and thus have less conventional memory available, the only other niggle is that 
text marked on the screen in Windows programs sometimes will not delete with the 
Del key and I have to hit the mouse key combination (middle + left) to delete. 
But that always works. Now I just have to learn the other key combinations that I 
have programmed so that I can copy and paste and more, all with the mouse. Cursor 
handling is also very good, with one or two options that I would try except for 
the compatibility factor; I often have to work on other PC systems, and it gets 
harder if there are too many differences.</P> 
 
<H3>Kudos for Canada</H3> 
 
<P>My last port of call was <A HREF="http://www.corel.ca/">Corel</A>, about five minutes 
before the fair closed. I had a brief but illuminating conversation was a helpful 
young lady about Corel Draw! and Ventura Publisher. My first question was 
about the forthcoming release of version 6.0 of both products, and were they 
specifically for Windows 95? The answer is yes. They simply will not run under 
older versions of Windows. Corel has decided to make a break with the 16-bit past 
with the latest versions. However, they offer their older programs at 
significantly lower prices compared to their latest ones. Given that the older 
programs had far more features than I could use, and many I would never need, 
that is not a bad deal at all.</P> 

<H3>Is Ventura in my future?</H3> 
 
<P>I got the impression that Ventura 5.0 was something of a maintenance release, 
albeit with a revised interface, and I wonder a bit if Corel are really committed 
to desktop publishing. I'll look out for them again at Imprinta in June to 
get some further comments.</P> 
 
<P>One good thing about Corel Draw! is that it comes with lots of good-quality 
clipart. It also includes a rather limited paint program for bit-mapped files; I 
won't call it an editor, since the version I used occasionally in Tokyo had very 
limited drawing capabilities. But at the moment I find that I can edit 
scanned files reasonably well with 
the <A HREF="http://www.trust.box.nl/">Image Pals</A> program that came with the Trust 
9600 scanner.</P> 
 
<P>At the moment I am wondering what to do for a high-end drawing and graphics 
program. I have <A HREF="http://www.micrografx.com/">Micrografx</A> Windows Draw, but it 
has a number of limitations. The biggest one is that it does not handle 
EPS files. GEM Artline does, but it does not run under Windows, so I hardly ever use 
it. Again, Image Pals handles EPS files, although it 
and <A HREF="http://www.qdeck.com/">Hijaak</A> and the paint program that came 
with <A HREF="http://www.omnipage.com/">Omnipage</A> squabble 
with each other over file formats and I virtually have to restrict myself 
to re-editing an EPS file with the program that originally produced it. The 
alternatives are to get one of the older versions of Corel Draw!, 
or to see if there is a good (and inexpensive) program for OS/2.</P> 
 
<P>Ventura is another matter. It would be nice to update to version 5.00, since 4.1.1 
has a number of problems that betray its roots in GEM. My main concern now with 
Ventura would be reprinting and updating old files. If version 5.0 is not too 
expensive and the interface not to difficult to learn, I would get 
it. But in the end I will move over to FrameMaker for productive work. I just 
wish its interface was less cranky and some of the features worked more predictably. 
In short, it is not that easy to learn, whatever the manual says.</P> 
 
<P>Talking of <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">FrameMaker</A>, I believe that they are 
releasing version 5.0. I bought version 4.0 just a few months ago, and have barely 
scratched the surface of it. Will the upgrade be expensive? Will it be 32-bit only?</P> 
 
<P>I plan to 
install <A HREF="http://www.software.ibm.com/os/warp/html3/index.htm">OS/2</A> on my 
second hard disk in July, after returning from vacation in the UK. Another matter 
under considering is whether to get ISDN and do some serious Net-surfing, as 
Web homepages are just a little s-l-o-w with a 14.4 kbs modem. The prime issue for 
me is that many companies can be contacted via the Web, and it seems that this is 
also a growing route for file downloads.</P> 
 
<P>Meanwhile, I have to do battle with FrameMaker until I write the next column.</P>
