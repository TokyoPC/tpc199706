<H1>Ionic Column - March 1996</H1>
<P>
</P>
<H2>by David Parry</H2>
<HR>
<H5>Englishman David Parry lived in Tokyo from 1980 to 1994 and was 
a member of TPC from 1986. A frequent contributor to this publication, 
he was Newsletter Publisher from late 1988 to early 1990 and 
began the Ionic Column in 1992. This column has won a prize and an 
honorable mention in newsletter awards. To the Tokyo BBS community, 
he now lives in virtual cyberspace and teleports textually over the 
ether. On the physical level, he currently lives and works in 
Düsseldorf, that part of Germany that most resembles Japan.</H5> 
 
<P>At long last I got to see this column in print when the December 
1995 and January 1996 Algorithmicas plopped into my mailbox.  I got 
all nostalgic and dewy-eyed when I read about the trials and 
tribulations of the current publishorial team and the angsts of 
learning desktop publishing.  This reminds me of the good old 
days... and the pterodactyl.</P> 
 
<H3>Man-sized</H3> 

<P>One sentence did make me laugh.  It was to the effect that the 
AJ was not really big enough to warrant the use of a full desktop 
publishing package because it was only monochrome.  I don't think 
that any user group is printing in color yet, probably not even 
the behemoths of Boston or Houston.  Why not? It costs far too 
much.  And in any case, what do they mean by color?  A mugshot of 
the prez, with matching red nose and eyes? Or spot color with a 
few stripes and bars and boxes in blue or red?</P>   

<H3>Adding local color</H3> 

<P>Spot color is not difficult to do, and most Windows programs can 
do it to some extent.  The latter can be done with spot color, 
which simply requires a second or third printing with the extra 
color(s).  DTP packages can handle that very easily, and it is 
not too expensive in absolute terms, but it still costs a fair bit 
more than glorious monochrome.  The main problem is alignment unless 
the program also provides crop marks for the printer to align 
everything.  Now that is the kind of feature that DTP programs 
do think of.</P> 
 
<H3>Adding Technicolor</H3> 

<P>If you want full four-color printing and plate-making for color 
prints, then take out your check book, or better yet, a second 
mortgage.  My understanding is that PC and Mac program are not 
of professional standard in handling four-color printing, with 
certain critical things handled badly or not at all.  I like the 
terminology, though, since talk of traps and knockouts adds a 
decidedly vigorous ring to a very staid profession.</P> 

<H3>A backwards glance</H3> 

<P>But how was the TPC newsletter put together in the past?  Mike 
and Paul came into the TPC after Mike Gray had handed over to 
Dori Horn.  Dori started a new tradition of using Ami Pro, but 
before that the newsletter had been put together using 
<A HREF="http://www.corel.ca/">Ventura Publisher</A> for several years.</P>  

<P>It must be said that current word processors such as 
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">WinWord</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.lotus.com/">Ami Pro</A> can 
do much of what Ventura does.  The 
visible difference often comes down to details, such as type 
and line spacing.  One particular advantage of Ventura is the 
ability to merge different files without making them into part of 
the document, so we could recycle old files with a bit of editing, 
or else keep some place for a file that we knew was on the way.  
I have not seen MS Publisher, but I would guess that it 
looks and works something like a cross between WinWord 
and <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">PageMaker</A>.</P> 
 
<H3>AJ circa 1986</H3> 
 
<P>To put things into the correct sequence; when I joined the TPC 
in 1986, copywriter Wick Smith almost single-handedly put the 
newsletter together in <A HREF="http://www.corel.ca/">Word Perfect</A>.  
I think Patrick Hochner 
then helped to actually print the newsletter, performing 
miracles with the original LaserJet Plus and DOS-based fonts.</P>  
 
<P>Then Federico Sancho took over with editor John Scherb, 
using his considerable publishing and layout experience to 
produce a clean and effective template for the newsletter.  That 
lasted in one form or another for some years.  He printed the 
newsletter in <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">PostScript</A> 
on an <A HREF="http://www.info.apple.com/">Apple</A> LaserWriter, 
and included a cover graphic of a well-known Japanese 
mountain that was used for about two years until there 
were calls from the readership for a change.  Federico handed 
over the templates at the end of 1988, and then it was up to 
me.</P>  
 
<H3>AJ circa 1988</H3> 
 
<P>I had been using Ventura Publisher for about a year and 
a half by then.  This was the &quot;classic&quot; version 2.0 
of Ventura, which ran under GEM.  Ventura was the &quot;killer ap&quot; 
that could have made the GEM operating system really big, at 
a time when Windows was just a pane.</P> 
 
<H3>A detour for GEM</H3> 

<P>GEM was a GUI (graphic user interface) just like <P>
Windows, and could handle the same range of input 
and output devices available at that time.  It had a faster and 
sleeker interface than the versions of Windows 
available up to 1990, it worked better with monochrome than 
Windows does, and remained substantially unchanged after about 1986.</P> 
 
<H3>Do you remember when...</H3> 
 
<P>GEM and GEM programs had some very irritating quirks.  
They imposed a dictatorial directory structure 
that would probably have been a major nuisance on a LAN, 
but I did not encounter networks until Windows 
3.0 was out.  GEM programs were a very mixed bunch, without 
a really consistent look or feel, and there were relatively 
few of them.  Worse yet, there were only ever three really good 
programs that I know of; Ventura Publisher, Per:FORM and 
GEM Artline.  And I had all three.  Add to that GEM Draw, the 
somewhat toy-like but eminently workable paint program that came 
with GEM Desktop.</P> 
 
<H3>A dead-end</H3> 

<P>But if you want to talk of shelfware, I once had Windows 2.0 
and Windows/386.  The difference between Digital Research 
and Microsoft was that Microsoft kept on trying.</P> 
 
<H3>Win 2.0!</H3> 

<H3>Win/386!</H3> 
 
<P>Ventura Publisher stagnated with GEM, and belatedly converted 
to Windows.  Per:FORM is a form generator from Delrina, and an 
updated version is called Form Flo.  I upgraded to the Windows 
version of Per:FORM and primarily use it to make out invoices.  
Just like Ventura, Per:FORM shows clear traces of its ancestry, 
with the old GEM key combinations, tiresome font handling, 
and a tendency to have unexpected and unrecoverable memory 
problems.</P> 
 
<P>Artline is a decent but orphaned graphics program, and I 
still have it, because it is the only program that 
I have at the moment that can edit PostScript EPS files.  
It is the most robust program of the three and works 
well, but I will get <A HREF="http://www.corel.ca/">Corel Draw!</A> 
or something similar later this year.</P> 
 
<P>Maybe it's on a shelf somewhere now, or maybe I gave 
it away in Tokyo before I left, but I used to have 
the full GEM Desktop set.  I had hoped that this would make 
for a more consistent setup, until I discovered 
that it was impossible to get all my GEM programs to run 
under the GEM Desktop, and the run-time versions conflicted.</P> 
 
<H3>Win 3.0!</H3> 
 
<P>Windows made the breakthrough with version 3.0 in 1990 
with at least three major features: consistent 
font handling, TrueType fonts, and more advanced memory 
management.  Much of that only really came to 
fruition a year later in Windows 3.1, which also included 
relatively good LAN management features.  But 
by that time I was in the process of swapping from 
GEM Ventura to Ventura for Windows, since it was 
clear that nothing else was going to appear in GEM form.</P> 
 
<H3><A HREF="http://www.lasermaster.com/lmhome.html">LaserMaster</A></H3> 
 
<P>But back to the publishing.  I had a full DTP system, 
with an Acer 386/16, a LaserView 19&quot; high-
resolution monochrome screen, and a LaserJet II with the 
LaserMaster CAPCard.  The latter was cheaper 
and faster than a PostScript printer at that time; 
Federico spoke of waiting 20 minutes for a page to emerge.</P>  

<H3>LM CAPCard</H3> 

<P>The original CAPCard offered 35 Bitstream fonts designed to 
precisely match the equivalent PostScript fonts in width.  
You could use fonts in fixed sizes or scaled on the fly, but 
the former were distinctly better, especially in the most 
common sizes.  Screen fonts in the intermediate sizes were 
truly dreadful.  Thus a large part of my disk was parking space 
for the screen and printer fonts.  The difference today is that 
TrueType and ATM can do a good job of scaling, so you don't need 
to compile sets of fonts, and you do not need to keep separate 
printer and screen fonts.</P> 
 
<H3>135 Fonts!</H3> 
 
<H3>LM Series III</H3> 

<P>In 1990 I changed to their Series III model, which offered 
135 fonts, compatibility with PostScript Type 1 fonts, 
a PostScript emulator program to print out PostScript files, 
and font scaling on the fly.  The good news; no more sets of 
compiled fonts in fixed sizes.  The bad news; the fonts.  
Only the same 35 fonts as before were an exact match for the 
equivalent PostScript fonts (virtually all PostScript 
printers have the same set of fonts, with small variations).  
The other 100 fonts were an eclectic mix, of which perhaps 30 
were useful.  The remainder were perhaps useful for things like 
party invitations.  The really bad news was that LaserMaster 
had changed over to URW fonts.  I would rate them as scarcely 
better than shareware in terms of quality, and probably shareware 
fonts nowadays would be better.  The default font on the 
Series III was an especially revolting Times Roman that could 
not be replaced because it was the default system font.  
For non-typographers, Times Roman is the font that is generally 
used for the main body text of newspapers, and its TrueType cousin 
is generally the standard font in Windows programs.</P> 
 
<H3>Where's the intelligence?</H3> 

<P>There are two basic options for font cards and controllers, 
be they LaserMaster or PostScript.  Either the intelligence is 
in the computer or in the printer.  LaserMaster used the first 
solution.  A special add-on card did all the processing in the 
PC and downloaded the result as a graphic dump over a special 
high-speed connection that went to the special I/O port on the 
printer.  It was very fast, but required the PC and the 
printer to be directly connected.  No good on a LAN, of course, 
unless you were prepared to dedicate a machine as a print server.</P>  
 
<H3>PostScript</H3> 
 
<P>PostScript puts the intelligence in the printer, which means 
that the PC CPU is freed up more quickly (immediately on a 
LAN, since the job goes into the spooler) and the printer can 
be shared in a number of ways.  Early PostScript printers were 
painfully slow, but faster processing chips made all the difference.  
Also, <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</A> 
cut the licensing fees to reasonable levels, so the 
cost advantage of the LaserMaster solution just evaporated.</P> 
 
<H3>Loyal LaserMaster users</H3> 

<P>Andreas Braem and Mike Gray and I all used these LaserMaster 
font cards at that time.  Andreas had a newer LaserView monitor 
than mine, Mike stayed with color VGA.  Mike used a variety of 
printing systems, including the Windows printing system that 
was another LaserMaster product, but then he went over to 
PostScript.  I used PostScript on 
an <A HREF="http://www.hp.com/">HP LJ 4</A> when I was 
back at Procom for just under a year, but I had to go back 
to using my HP LJ III and the Series III for my last year 
in Japan.  Very reluctantly.  It was obvious that the new 
RISC-based PostScript chips were as fast or faster than the 
LaserMaster method, and there were no problems with LANs.  I 
sold my Series III on leaving Japan and once again use an 
LJ 4 with PostScript.</P> 
 
<P>I also used an add-on font cartridge from PDS on my printer, 
mainly with XyWrite.  It had no screen fonts for Ventura, 
so I used the LaserMaster fonts with Ventura and later with 
Windows.</P> 
 
<P>Using the big monitor also ensured an endless quest for new 
and better drivers.  Between that and the LaserMaster font cards, 
it was hard to get everything working consistently.  In one epic 
moment in early 1990, the system crashed when we were about to 
print the final version.  Editor Chris Case took the backup 
files over to Andreas Braem in Kamakura and an issue emerged.</P>

<H3>Teamwork</H3> 

<P>Producing the newsletter is a lengthy business, so it became 
a matter of teamwork.  The publisher was the person with the 
best knowledge of DTP, and a team of editors handled the text.  
Initially I worked with Wolfgang Bechstein as editor and 
Andreas Braem as assistant editor and publisher, followed by 
Peter Evans as editor, and then for a short and tempestuous 
time Chris Case held the editorial reins.  A frequent and 
welcome assistant was TPC stalwart 
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Bernat.David">David Bernat</A>
.  It was a 
great team, and I enjoyed working with them all.</P> 
 
<P>Credit where credit is due: it was Wolfgang Bechstein who 
coined the term &quot;publishorial&quot; to describe the 
DTP jocks in the newsletter team.  I believe the correct 
linguistic term is &quot;back-formation&quot;, as he created it 
by analogy with &quot;editorial&quot;.  How long before this new coinage 
enters the OED?</P> 
 
<H3>Pterodactyl</H3> 
 
<H3>Jurassic Koen</H3> 

<P>Andreas had a similar system with a newer LaserView monitor, 
and a different printer.  His workstation was overshadowed  
overflown, really  by a huge pterodactyl that permanently 
hovered in the updraught from his monitor.  Some of the issues 
were put together in Kamakura while Andreas dispensed exquisite 
culinary delights.  Over in the corner, star editor 
Wolfgang Bechstein wielded a ruthless blue pencil while 
commenting that he had only two hours of sleep the night 
before due to a particularly hectic translation job. 
We always seemed to end up with the final version practically 
being tugged out of the printer before we dashed off madly to 
Kita-Kamakura station and caught the 10:42 &quot;blue train&quot;.  Even 
now I can remember the time of the last train out.</P>

<H3>Handover</H3> 

<P>Severe time and financial constraints forced me to hand over 
to a willing volunteer as soon as I had got a headlock on a 
suitable candidate (&quot;You have Ventura Publisher and a printer 
with lots of fonts and a scanner? How about....&quot; &quot;Aaaaaargh! 
All right! I'll do it!&quot;) in Spring 1990. Journalist Mike Gray 
volunteered to take over for a while.  I remained as assistant 
publisher in reserve to help out if Mike was away.  Which 
he was from time to time; he went off to cover the Gulf War and 
recounted stories of trying to eat dinner in Tel Aviv while 
wearing a gas mask.  I stayed on as assistant publisher for about 
a year and then handed over.  Shortly after that, Mike handed 
over the reins to Dori Horn.</P>  
 
<H3>Rolling your own</H3> 

<P>Working as publisher was a nerve-wracking business, but 
great fun.  One thing has not changed for the editor, and that 
is the desperate search for home-brewed material.  We occasionally 
reprinted articles from other user group newsletters, and on 
one epic occasion we reprinted an April Fool's article in all 
seriousness.  Eagle-eyed Wolfgang spotted this, so it must 
have been after his period of tenure.  But we always gave 
priority to articles from TPC members, even if these did come 
in at the last moment.  Some things never change.</P>

<P>Next month: a report from CeBIT, which is the biggest computer 
trade show in Europe.  It is held in Hannover in the middle of 
March every year.</P> 
 
<P><I>Editor's and Publisher's note:</I></P> 
 
<P><I>Pumping out the AJ is still &quot;a nerve-wracking business,&quot; 
and still &quot;great fun.&quot;</I></P> 
 
<P><I>And we still &quot;give priority to articles from TPC members,&quot; 
and they still &quot;come in at the last moment.&quot;&lt;G&gt;</I></P> 
 
<P><I>Thanks for the blast from the past, David. It's good to 
know the history behind the AJ.</I></P>  
 
<P><I>Here's to the future!</I></P>
