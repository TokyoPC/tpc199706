<P>This has been a month with lots of changes, for the TPC and for me, 
personally.  We've negotiated a new place for monthly meetings: starting 
with the May meeting we'll meet at 
the <A HREF="http://www.iac.co.jp/~mikecarr/tbc1.html">Tokyo British Club</A>, 
in the Oak Room in the basement.  Although the room is a bit smaller 
than the church's hall, it's a fully equipped theater, has a good 
sound system, has a bar in the room itself as well as a pub upstairs, 
and is available for more than two hours longer in the evening.  The 
room rental is almost the same as what we were paying the church, 
nijikais will be less hassle, and we have been assured that our 
reservations will have priority.   Please read TPC President 
Kevin Ryan's
<A HREF="http:pres9603.html">Prez Sez column</A>, for more details.</P>
 
<P>I've been a member of the British Club since last summer or so (yes, 
they take Californians, too), but it was 
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Bernat.David">David Bernat</A>
 who first thought 
about approaching their very hospitable, professional, and cooperative 
General Manager, Mr. Mike Marklew, with our proposal.  The ExCom had 
already had a couple of meetings there, and several TPC members are 
fairly regular visitors; TPC Sysop Frank <i>Tone</i> Angstead plays there 
with two bands (XLH and The Hit Men) and as a solo act on occasion, too.  
It's a very nice venue, convenient and friendly, and we are still 
working out several more ways in which the TPC and the TBC can be of 
use to one another.</P>
 
<P>We have several new Execs in the ExCom (please look at the list in 
Kevin's column), as we've made official the positions of several people 
who have been contributing time and expertise on a continuing basis to 
the TPC.  I personally owe all of them a lot of gratitude for advice and 
help since I've been a member, and I'm happy to be working with them.  I 
haven't had a chance yet to work out with each of them whether they want 
their names and contact information shown in the AJ, nor have I worked 
out yet with Paul whether/where/how we could fit them into the Exec 
list on the inside cover.  I'll try to get this done by next issue.  
Meanwhile, though, please join me in wishing them a very sincere 
&quot;Welcome Aboard!&quot;.</P>
 
<P>On a more individual note, I finally succumbed to the impulse to install 
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Windows 95</A> on The Beast.  
Being prudent (rather unusual for me, actually), 
I set things up so that most of Win95 resides on my D: drive, a 1GB SCSI 
<A HREF="http://www.quantum.com/">Quantum</A> Empire 
drive which I do not trust at all.  We had trouble with it 
and its replacements on the BBS, and on The Beast it doesn't respond 
quickly enough to be recognized by the system on boot-up, maybe 30% or 
so of the time.  I left Windows 3.11 pretty much intact on my C: drive 
(a steadfast <A HREF="http://www.wdc.com/">Western Digital</A> Caviar 
540MB IDE drive), so I can start 
the system using a floppy boot disk and have my original Win 3.11 
configuration, or without the floppy and get into Win95.</P> 
 
<P>So far the experiment is working fairly well....  Win95 is at least 
stable enough that when it crashes it does so gracefully, hardly ever 
bringing the whole system down, generally just the application that I 
was working on at the time, leaving all the rest, and the OS, unscathed.</P> 
 
<P>So far, so good, but I'm in the midst of gathering advice from TPC's 
resident experts on how properly to 
get <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape</A> Gold working under 
Win95.  As soon as I get done with this issue of the AJ, I'm going to 
see if I can get it running right.  I caught pneumonia this last week, 
and it slowed me down some, so I haven't been able to devote much time 
to it. If it still doesn't work, I'll try another version of Netscape 
I downloaded today.  If that goes well, I plan to start a project to 
produce a homepage for myself, for which purpose
<A HREF="http:homepage.html">Darren Cook's article</A>
should come in very handy.  Maybe I'll have good news to report next 
issue.</P> 
 
<P>Finally, let me call your attention to the inside cover, with more 
telephone and fax numbers where you can reach me.</P>
