<H1>How to Make Your Home Page in 10 Minutes</H1>
<P>

<P>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the set of format 
instructions for the World Wide Web.  Many people seem to think that it 
is complicated, something that needs one of those 1,000-page 
books to learn.</P> 
 
<P>This article is hopefully going to show you how easy it is.  Not only can 
you make your home page in ten minutes, but you will also not need any 
special tools.  We are going to use Notepad.  You cannot get much 
simpler than that.</P> 
 
<P>There are lots of special editors for HTML, as well as an add-on for 
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Word</A>, but my argument 
is that as this is only going to take ten minutes, you will have written 
your web page by the time you have installed those other systems, and 
by the time you have learnt how to use them and are just creating your 
first page, you will already have made a suite of pages, all 
inter-linked, telling the world about you, your philosophy and 
interesting anecdotes about your friends and family.</P> 
 
<P>Also, more importantly, when you want to get clever and stretch the 
boundaries of HTML, then you will probably have to do it this way anyway.</P> 
 
<P>There are some catches. To do this in ten minutes, you have to:</P> 

   <OL><LI>Already have the picture(s) you want to use on the page, and they 
  need to be in GIF or JPEG format.  Lots of public domain programs let 
  you do this.  Of course, you can have a home page without pictures.	
  
   <LI>If you want to provide some links from your page, you must already 
   have the &quot;HTTP://...&quot; addresses scribbled down somewhere.  Of course, 
   you can have a home page with no links. 
   
   <LI>To view your masterpiece, and check it looks okay, you will need a 
   browser.  I recommend <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape</A>, 
   but Mosaic, etc., will do.  Tip: buy at least one copy of the 
   Japanese magazine called &quot;Internet&quot;, as the 
   CD that comes with it has a comprehensive selection of Internet 
   software for Windows, Mac and UNIX.  
  
   <LI>You must already have an idea what you want to write.  This is the 
   tricky bit.  But here is a valuable idea (brace yourself), used on 
   the majority of web pages I have seen: write anything, do not worry 
   about whether it is good or bad, two sentences or twenty paragraphs, 
   and then at the top of the page put &quot;THIS PAGE IS UNDER
   CONSTRUCTION&quot;.</OL>
 
<P>You will not need to be on the Internet while you develop your 
page. Learn offline, until NTT see the error of their ways, and 
provide the telephone service at sensible rates.  See STEP NINE, and 
the information box on starting Netscape, for details.</P> 
 
<P><B>STEP ONE:</B> Start Windows then start File Manager, and make a new 
directory called HOMEPAGE in C:\.  (Can be anywhere, can be called 
anything).  TIME BUDGET: 60 seconds.</P> 
 
<P><B>STEP TWO:</B> Start Notepad (called ME-MO-SHI on Japanese systems).  It 
is normally in the Accessories group in Program Manager.  I always 
move it to the the Main group, as it so useful.  TIME BUDGET: 20 
seconds.</P> 
 
<P><B>STEP THREE:</B> Okay here is some theory.  The layout information in 
HTML is done with &quot;tags&quot;.  These are command words that start with 
the <B>&lt;</B> symbol and end with the <B>&gt;</B> symbol.  The 
<B>&lt;</B>, <B>&gt;</B> and everything between them will not 
appear on the web page.</P> 

<P>Type the following text into Notepad.  There are lots of tags here, 
and most of them are overhead - you will have to type this junk into 
every page you write:</P> 
 
<B>&lt;html&gt;</B><BR> 
<B>&lt;head&gt;</B><BR> 
<B>&lt;title&gt;MY FIRST HOME PAGE&lt;/title&gt;</B><BR> 
<B>&lt;/head&gt;</B><BR> 
<B>&lt;body&gt;</B><BR> 
<P></P> 
 
<B>&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</B><BR> 
 
<P>The tags can be lower-case, upper-case or a mixture.  You can spread 
the lines out more, or squeeze it all on to one line — the browser 
will ignore blank lines and tabs.  Spelling is important, as is the 
initial forward slash (/) character at the start of three of the tags.</P> 
 
<P>More theory: Some tags comes in pairs, the first one is the command 
name, e.g.,. &lt;title&gt; while the end one has the same tag name 
but with that &quot;/&quot; character, e.g., &lt;/title&gt;.  What this means 
is that everything between the start and end tag is affected by 
that tag.  In this case it means that MY FIRST HOME PAGE is the 
title of this web page.  What that means is that when you load it 
into your browser, &quot;MY FIRST HOME PAGE&quot; will appear in the title bar.  
TIME BUDGET: 1 minute, 40 seconds.</P> 
 
<P><B>STEP FOUR:</B> We left a blank line between &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; 
and this is where your text goes. In other words the 
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; line is always the last line in the file.</P> 
 
<P>So, move the cursor to that blank line, and type in these lines:</P> 
<P><B>&lt;h1&gt;MY TEN-MINUTE HOME PAGE!&lt;/h1&gt;Hello my name is Darren. Thank you 
for coming to my page. Please note that it is still UNDER CONSTRUCTION. 
&lt;br&gt;I am going to tell you all about the meaning of life in a moment, 
but first I want to show you a picture:</B></P> 
 
<P>Three new tags to learn: &lt;h1&gt; ...  &lt;/h1&gt;. This starts and stops 
a big heading (it is a ONE after the &quot;h&quot;).  The browser will 
automatically start a new line after a heading.  However, since 
normally the browser ignores your carriage returns, blank lines and 
tabs, we have to use a tag to tell it when we want it to start a new 
line.  I use &lt;br&gt;.  There is no closing tag to worry about.  (The 
books may suggest you use &lt;p&gt; — in this case they both do the 
same thing).  TIME BUDGET: 2 minutes.</P> 
 
<P><B>STEP FIVE:</B> We are halfway—five minutes down, five to go.  If I am 
going too quickly for you, sorry, but this is as slow as I get.  Just 
type for the moment, think later.</P> 
 
<P>Now let's add a picture.  First you need to put the GIF file in 
c:\HOMEPAGE (or whatever directory you created earlier).  Use File 
Manager to do this.</P> 

<P>For this example I am going to assume your GIF file is called 
&quot;FACE.GIF&quot;.  I am giving you a whole minute to find your GIF file, 
and put it in c:\homepage.  Uncharacteristic generosity.  
TIME BUDGET: 60 seconds.</P> 
 
<P><B>STEP SIX:</B> Now directly under what we wrote in STEP FOUR, type this:</P> 
 
<P><B>&lt;img src=&quot;face.gif&quot;&gt;</B></P> 
 
<P>That is it!  One line!  I told you this was going to be easy.  It 
is just one tag (when you play around later, try putting a 
&lt;br&gt; just before it, to get it on a line of its own).  It 
starts &quot;img&quot; which stands for image.  Then a space, then &quot;src&quot; 
(which stands for source) an equals sign, and then the filename in 
quotation marks.  Finally the &quot;&gt;&quot; to close the tag.  HTML is 
easy-going on upper and lower case, carriage-returns, etc. but is 
very fussy about closing your tags.  TIME BUDGET: 30 seconds.</P> 
 
<P><B>STEP SEVEN:</B> Almost forgot!  We had better save our file!  Go to 
FILE menu in Notepad, and click SAVE AS.  Move into c:\HOMEPAGE, 
and then for the filename type this: HOME.HTM.  Click OK to save 
it.</P> 

<P>Important Tip: When you move it on to your Internet Provider, so 
that the world can see it, chances are that you will need to 
rename it to &quot;HOME.HTML&quot;.</P> 
 
<P>Those of you using <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Windows 95</A> 
or NT, can call it HOME.HTML right 
from the beginning of course.  TIME BUDGET: 45 seconds.</P> 
 
<P><B>STEP EIGHT:</B> Now let's add a link!  Type this text in:</P> 
 
<B>&lt;br&gt;</B><BR> 
<B>&lt;br&gt;</B><BR> 
<B>&lt;a HREF=&quot;http://www.factcomm.co.jp/</B><BR>
<B>fact/staff/darren/ehome.html&quot;&gt;Go and see Darren!&lt;/a&gt;</B><BR> 
 
 
<P>In the unlikely event that you want to provide a link to my home 
page you can type this in as it stands.  Otherwise you will want 
to replace the http:// address.</P> 
 
<P>We give &lt;br&gt; twice.  This will leave an extra blank line after 
the image (Advanced Tip: this is why I prefer to use &lt;br&gt; 
instead of &lt;p&gt;, because however many &lt;p&gt;'s in a row you have, 
it will only give one blank line).</P> 
 
<P>Next we have &lt;a&gt;Some text&lt;/a&gt; (I split it over 3 lines 
above, to make it easier to read).</P> 
 
<P>The &lt;a&gt; (it stands for anchor) starts the link, and the 
&lt;/a&gt; closes the link.  The text in the middle is what 
will appear on the home page, in blue (by default).  When this blue 
text is clicked it will jump to another web page whether that page 
is another one you have written, or written by someone else and 
residing on a computer on the other side of the world (Cor... just 
like magic!).</P> 
 
<P>We tell it where to go by putting some extra stuff inside the 
first &lt;a&gt; tag.  It starts HREF= (just as &lt;a&gt; stands for 
&quot;anchor&quot;, HREF stands for the equally intuitive &quot;Hypertext 
Reference&quot;) and is then followed by the http:// address in 
quotation marks.  And of course you must remember to put not only 
the closing quotation marks at the end, but then also the &quot;&gt;&quot; 
to close the tag.</P> 
 
<P>The other thing to be careful of is to give the HTTP address 
exactly.  If it is wrong then your page will still look correct, 
but anyone clicking it will get that wonderfully techie message 
&quot;URL NOT FOUND&quot;.</P> 
 
<P>(Advanced Tip: If you are linking to another page that you have 
written, that is in the same directory, there is a very simple 
shortcut: you only need to give the filename,e.g.,. &lt;a 
HREF=&quot;jhome.html&quot;&gt;Japanese version here&lt;/a&gt;).  
TIME BUDGET: 75 seconds.</P> 
 
<P><B>STEP NINE:</B> We have one and a half minutes left, and we are finished!  
Just time to test it!  Save your file, and without closing down 
Notepad, start Netscape (or whatever browser you are using).  See 
the information box on starting Netscape without the expense of going 
online.</P> 
 
<P>In Netscape, go to FILE menu, and choose &quot;Open File&quot;.  It brings up 
the usual windows dialog box.  Go to c:\HOMEPAGE directory, and you 
should see HOME.HTM listed.  Double click it, and the page we just 
typed in should be there, with the image and the link.</P> 
 
<P>The link will not work unless you are online of course (if you 
try it, it will think for a while and then say no DNS entry or some 
similar error).</P> 
 
<P>Go back to Notepad.  Type something new at the end.  &quot;This is a test&quot; 
is always popular.  Save the file again.  Now go back to Netscape and 
click Reload.  Hopefully, your new text will appear.  This can give you 
a quick way of developing, as you can see your changes almost instantly.</P> 
 
<P>To learn more HTML either buy one of those books, or whenever you 
visit someone's page, and you want to do what they do, most browsers 
will let you look at the source.  Learn from them.  The dishonest 
among you can simply cut the good bit from their page, paste it into 
your own page, and make a few cosmetic changes.  TIME BUDGET: 
90 seconds (not counting the time to set your browser up).</P>

<H3>Using Netscape Offline:</H3>
 
<P>Netscape (under Windows 3.X) wants to have Winsock running, which 
normally means you need to dial up to an Internet provider.  While 
Winsock is dialing, simply hit &lt;esc&gt; to abort the logon, and 
Winsock and Netscape will continue to load, and will run offline 
with no trouble.</P>
