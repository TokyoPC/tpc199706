<P>With two kids and a penchant for buying software, I have wasted a lot 
of money in the last couple of years.  I am writing this in the hope that 
you can avoid some of the worst experiences of buying Multimedia 
Software for Preschoolers.</P> 
 
<P>I adjusted <A HREF="http://www.intuit.com/quicken/">Quicken</A> 
after a year of inputting receipts and found that 
I had spent $4,500 in computer-related goods, and I didn't even buy a 
new computer!  Part of that was on an inordinate amount of software 
for kids.  It helped that I was a featured speaker for a teachers' 
conference on children's multimedia.  I had an &quot;excuse&quot; other than 
being an oya-baka.</P> 
 
<P>Julia is five, and is just starting to read hiragana and romaji.  I 
use the software to help the balance between her yochien and English.  
She has used many programs to get to this point, but I think the most 
important factor was that she spent time with English.  Many of the 
programs I will review today are pretty weak pedagogically, but most 
were interesting enough to keep her coming back.</P> 
 
<P>Before we get to the software, I would like to point out that any 
software will be pretty ineffective if you sit the kid down in front 
of the computer and walk off.  You need to watch, help, and keep 
the kid &quot;on task&quot;.  Keep your hands off the mouse, though.  It's 
her game.</P> 
 
<H3>The Cream of the Crop</H3> 
 
<P>You know a piece of software is good if you and your kid fight 
over it.  Kid Pix Studio is one of these.  It's open-ended, and not 
much good for language learning, but is a great set of tools to 
let your creativity run free.  Kid Pix 
vaulted <A HREF="http://www.broderbund.com/">Broderbund</A> software 
ahead of the pack about five years ago.  This new version has an 
improved version of the kid-style paint program with many new 
kinds of &quot;brushes&quot; and effects you can warp your bad drawing with.  
But on this $40 CD-ROM, you get five other activities that can blow 
your mind.  There is a slide-show, animated presentations, video 
with animation overlay and manipulation of animated characters 
with playback features.  Outstanding.</P> 
 
<P>Reader Rabbit's Interactive Reading Journey by 
<A HREF="http://www.learningco.com/">The Learning Company</A> takes 
the kids through letters of the alphabet (in a very 
interesting order) while exposing them to phonetic elements they 
will need in reading.  Each stop along the way has a half-dozen 
activities that culminate in a &quot;game&quot; that, when 
&quot;won&quot; allows the traveller to pass on to the next letter.  
Solid pedagogy behind this game.  Keeps my daughter coming back, 
too.  Invaluable combination.</P> 
 
<P>If your kid is studying English at school, chances are that they 
are using the Oxford &quot;Let's Go&quot; series.  
<A HREF="http://www.dyned.com/">DynED</A> has 
recently adapted the series to CD-ROM with unusual success.  
It has managed to keep the spirit of the book (and follow the 
content very closely) while adding features only possible on 
CD-ROM.  DynED managed to loosen up their standard stiff interface 
for the kids and make it fun to play.  My daughter still thinks 
it is a game.  Not so for parents, who have to fork over 
&#165;12,000 for a CD that covers half of each level 
(yes, it's &#165;12,000 for the other half, too).</P> 
 
<H3>Middle of the Road</H3> 
 
<P>Broderbund's Living Books series started with the hit Just Grandma 
and Me, which now comes bundled with about any computer you buy 
in Japan.  It is good at exposing kids to a neat environment, 
but the reading practice often gets lost in the 
click-and-make-funny-things-happen activities.  The trick is to 
make a game out of finding the words in the text (click on the 
word, you hear it, and it flashes).  Also on the same level are all 
the other Living Books: Arthur's Teacher Troubles is better, 
Ruff's Bone and Little Monster at School not so good.</P> 
 
<P>Bailey's Book House is expensive ($40) for the five basic 
activities you get.  They ported this software from the floppy version 
with very few changes, and it shows.  
<A HREF="http://www.edmark.com/">Edmark</A> always gets high marks 
in the Educational Technology journals for their series (Bailey's 
Book/Millie's Math/Sammy's Science) Houses.  I don't know why.  
Maybe because they run pretty effectively on older machines.</P> 
 
<P>Mieko, A Story of Japanese Culture by Digital Productions 
is very well put together.  Using a children's story about a girl in 
San Francisco, it explores all kinds of Japanese things like gardening 
and origami.  Much better than Voyager's (old) CD on Japan.  
(Check out <A HREF="http://www.voyagerco.com/">Voyager</A> for 
their excellent titles for older people.)  
The problem with Mieko is that my daughter loses interest quickly 
because the interface is too hard to navigate (and perhaps because 
she gets the same stuff in yochien).</P> 
 
<P>A Silly Noisy House by Voyager enjoyed a brief stint of 
acclaim in the Ed Tech magazines, but faded quickly.  It has a 
lot of neat places to click, but most of them have little to do 
with learning.  Best feature is the collection of children's songs 
and the matching game.  Cute, if you want to waste some time.</P> 
 
<H3>The Dogs</H3> 
 
<P>Wouldn't you know that <A HREF="http://www.disney.com/">Disney's</A> 
first foray into 
Interactive CD with The Lion King would be a flop. 
Beautiful graphics, but after once through the story, you say, 
&quot;That's all?&quot;  Yep.  That's all.  The three or 
four &quot;games&quot; put me to sleep.  If you have an 
ATI video card, it also does weird things 
on some of the screens.  (Customer Support: &quot;Get a new driver 
from ATI.&quot;)  They are now flogging a another one with newer 
features.  Watch out, they pay for a lot of advertisement.</P> 
 
<P>Fisher Price's ABCs is put out by Davidson, who must have sold 
out to get a quick buck.  This is not like their normal stuff.  
Three activities that you could do better on paper (except for 
the inane rhymes for each of the letters that are really 
annoying).  The kids spend more time amassing money to put in 
the jukebox where the learning activities reside than actually 
learning.  Definitely not worth the cash, at whatever price they 
are fishing for.</P> 
 
<P>My Talking Dictionary is a click-and-hear interface that 
includes so much text that using it is inappropriate until an 
age where the vocabulary has already been acquired, making it pretty 
much useless.</P>  

<H3>Another Opinion</H3> 
 
<P>Passing on information from <A HREF="http://pathfinder.com/">Time</A> magazine 
(Feb. 19, 1996, p.49) quoting Entertainment Weekly, the 
article pans Schoolhouse Rock: Grammar Rock 
(<A HREF="http://www.ea.com/Creative_Wonders/CWmain.html">Creative Wonders</A>) 
and Dr. Seuss's ABCs (Broderbund's Living Books) for not being 
much more than their old versions (book or TV program), but 
liked Disney's Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree and 
especially Madeleine and the Magnificent Puppet Show.</P> 
 
<P>Me, I've already spent too much so I have invested in a couple of 
magazines to review multimedia software.  These are well worth the 
subscription price.  I don't buy nearly as much as I used to and 
am using it more.  A review of these magazines I will save for 
another article.</P>
