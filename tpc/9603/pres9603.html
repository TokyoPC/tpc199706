<H2>A Message from the President</H2>

<P>We started our February Exec meeting slowly.  I was depressed, feeling 
like I couldn't give to the TPC what it deserved, in time or gumption. 
Thoughts of excuses for quitting floated through my head as I realized 
how lame my report was to the Execs.  The new position at work, or the 
extended trip planned for this summer (2 months), came to mind.</P> 
 
<P>Then a very nice thing happened.  As each of the Execs gave their reports, 
I realized that people really are interested in keeping this thing 
going - and even improving it!  Sure there was contention on a couple of 
issues, but that is always a good sign.  The best part was the influx of 
new blood.</P> 
 
<P>
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Woodward.Stuart">Stuart Woodward</A>
 is our new Secretary.  Stuart has served as President 
before with a secretary named Kevin under him.  Times have changed, 
eh? &lt;g&gt;.  We are glad to have Stuart aboard, he brings with him more 
than expertise in computing: a time-tested awareness of how volunteer 
groups work.</P> 
 
<P>I'd also like to welcome 
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Perkins.Brian">Brian Perkins</A>
 to the Exec in his role 
(now made official) as Disc Librarian.  The change since our last Disk 
Librarian is that Brian brings CD-ROMs to meetings for lending, 
instead of floppies for sale.</P> 
 
<P>Also made official members of the Execs are Roland Hechtenberg 
(mailing coordinator), 
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Lipton.Charlie">Charlie Lipton</A>
 (BBS site coordinator), 
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Tittsler.Jim">Jim Tittsler</A>
 (consultant) and 
<A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~jwt/tpc/members.html#Cotton.Ken">Ken Cotton</A>
 (hotline coordinator).  Thanks to 
all for their continued contribution of time and expertise.</P> 
 
<P>Unfortunately, we have lost Robert Irizarry from the Exec because of 
time reasons, but he will continue to contribute as a regular member 
(and help Frank, our sysop, in emergencies).  He held the position of 
the Internet Liaison, a hard position to fill, but we need someone 
to act as our transfer person to the Internet, to find an affordable 
way easy enough for our members to practice Internet access (and get 
a taste of the real thing) until they can get access for themselves 
through a service provider.  This would be the ideal opportunity for 
someone to learn the ins and outs of the Internet business in the 
process of getting us the best deal with the best set-up.</P> 
 
<P>Ken cornered me after the meeting (he had just gotten in from work) 
and bent my ear about his plans for the hotline.  It should be up and 
running by the time you read this. (For those that haven't tried the 
hotline recently, it's been down since we lost a computer in our last 
move.)</P> 
 
<P>But the best part was the end of the meeting, when we checked out the 
new site.  The basement of 
the <A HREF="http://www.iac.co.jp/~mikecarr/tbc1.html">British Club</A> is 
smaller than the Church's, 
but it has many advantages, like a phone line onto the stage, areas 
upstairs for beginners' meetings, and Frank Angstead playing in the 
bar upstairs after the meeting (sometimes, anyway).  Oh, and there is a 
bar at the back of the meeting room so we don't have to rush off for 
bad pizza.  Food is served upstairs, too.</P>
 
<P>A projector would make it perfect.  Since we now have about 
&#165;1.7 million in the bank, I am going to propose at the next 
Exec meeting (March 14 at the British Club, all members welcome) 
that we bite the bullet and allot &#165;500,000 to buy one.  With 
this, we could have on-line demonstrations of the Internet and 
new software.  Visible by everyone.  This would increase 
interest in meetings and make it much easier to get presenters.</P> 
 
<P>I didn't realize how much I missed the TPC BBS until it was down.  
Due to circumstances beyond our control it was disconnected and 
then when reconnected, lost a hard disk.  Thanks to Frank and 
Todd for getting it up again so quickly.  It is an integral 
part of the TPC and makes organizing things much easier.</P> 
 
<P>So by the end of the meeting, my depression had vanished and I am looking 
forward to working with some of the most interesting people in Tokyo, on 
the Exec.  Like the saying goes, &quot;You don't have time, you make 
time.&quot;</P>
