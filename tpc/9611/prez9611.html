<H3>Greetings from a new writer in an old and well-worn slot.</H3> 
 
<P>So, what is the &quot;Prez Sez&quot; section of the <I>Algorithmica Japonica</I>?  In order to answer this question I went to reach for all my old copies of the AJ only to find they were at the office and I wasn't!</P> 
 
<P>Too late to stick a message in either the Help or Chit-Chat conferences of the BBS so I turned instead to investigate the ever-available database of comments, questions and answers on every imaginable topic that remains in the archives of the TPC BBS. With a couple years of input from members new and old it is an excellent resource.</P> 
 
<P>My plan was to find the WWW address to access old copies of the AJ on-line. Into the (M)essage database to (S)earch for messages (F)rom 
<A HREF="http:../members.html#Tittsler.Jim">Jim Tittsler</A>
 (the internet man) and messages with &quot;shrine&quot; (the only part of the address that came to mind) in the (B)ody. Success in minutes and off to Netscape.</P> 
 
<P>(Around this time I remembered I had one copy of the AJ in the apartment to review the &quot;How to Make Your Home Page in 10 Minutes&quot; article by Darren Cook in the 3/96 issue as well as the 10/96 article by Kurt Keller &quot;GIF My Home Page, Mr. JPG!&quot; Just as in this AJ that you are reading now, the WWW homepage address is to be found on the inside of the cover.  Oh well, at least I could confirm the address I had just located.)</P> 
 
<P>People and resources are what the TPC is about as you can see above. Using the local BBS, which is taken care of by Frank and Jim, is fine for those in Japan, and for those checking in from farther away many articles from the AJ have been placed onto the WWW site by Jim Tittlser,

<A HREF="http:../members.html#Woodward.Stuart">Stuart Woodward</A>
 and others — I'm going to have to stop mentioning names for fear of leaving out too many who do the real work to keep the TPC going.</P> 
 
<P>And these names are just the obvious ones. The club may be taken care of and 
administered by those listed on the inside cover of this newsletter but it is the people that sit in the audience that provide the real direction of where the club is to go.</P> 
 
<P>What do you want to see at the meetings? Presentations have to be about what interests 
you — <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Windows NT 4.0</A> is on the slate for November but what would you like to see next month? A few ideas including digital cameras have been suggested, but please keep the requests coming.</P> 
 
<P>How to keep in touch? In your hands is the paper version of the AJ: a good start. Within it you will find contact numbers and e-mail addresses you can use to make your wishes known. And if you have trouble using the BBS, the WWW (or any other 3+-letter 
computer-related abbreviations) just let us know and you can look forward to answers, 
suggestions and perhaps even a whole session on such topics.</P> 
 
<P>There is a lot of info and fun stuff out there and it should be readily accessible to you! If it isn't then let us know because as the previous writer of this column put it very recently, this is the Tokyo Personal Computer USERS Group — so lets USE those PCs!</P>
